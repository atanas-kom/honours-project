me011: Right.
fe008: that needs to be adjusted, because, I mean, these are very highly technical things. I mean, it's an added, uh, level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription, as I see it. But in any case, people can agree to things that are wrong. So.
me011: Well - Yeah. The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor - not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly,
fe008: And the reason I liked it was because -
me011: as opposed to, uh -
fe008: was because it, um - it gives them the option of, uh, being able to correct it.

me011: Mm-hmm.
fe008: what I meant to say was that it's the other group that's not - n- no m- no overlap with our present members. And then maybe it'd be good to set an explicit deadline, something like a week before that, uh, J- July fifteenth date, or two weeks before.
me013: I mean, I would suggest we discuss - I mean, if we're going to have a policy on it, that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people,
me011: Mm-hmm.
me013: so that we have a uniform thing. So, tha- that's a month, which is fine. I mean, it seems -
me011: Well, the only thing I said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth. I didn't give any other deadline.
me018: Twelve hours.
fe008: Mm-hmm.
me011: So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says, "wow I suddenly found something", we'll delete it from our record. We just won't delete it from whatever's already been released.
fe008: Hmm. That's a little bit difficult.
me011: What else can we do?
fe008: Yeah.
me011: If someone says "hey, look, I found something in this meeting and it's libelous and I want it removed". What can we do? We have to remove it.
fe008: Well. That's true. I - I agree with that part, but I think that it would - it, uh - we need to have, uh, a - a - a message to them very clearly that beyond this date, you can't make additional changes.
me013: I mean, um, I - I - i- I think that somebody might request something even though we say that. But I think it's good to at least start some place like that. So if we agreed,
fe008: Mm-hmm. Good.
me013: OK, how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have - if we say two weeks, or if we say a month, I think we should just say that - say that, you know, i- a- as um, "per the - the - the, uh, page you signed, you have the ability to look over this stuff" and so forth "and, uh, because we w-" these, uh - I would - I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say "because we, uh, will continually be making these things available to other researchers, uh, this can't be open-ended and so, uh, uh, please give us back your response within this am- you know, within this amount of time", whatever time we agree upon.

fe008: Oh, excellent.

mn017: Yeah.
me013: Let me look at this again.
me011: Right.
fe008: I - I really don't see that it's a problem. I - I think that it's a common courtesy to ask them -
me011: For - for th-
fe008: uh, to expect for them to, uh, be able to have @@ us try to contact them, u- just in case they hadn't gotten their email. I think they'd appreciate it.
me013: Yeah. My - Adam, my - my view before was about the nature of what was - of the presentation,
me011: Mm-hmm.
me013: of - of how my - my - the things that we're questioning were along the lines of how easy - uh, h- how m- how much implication would there be that it's likely you're going to be changing something, as opposed to - That was the kind of dispute I was making before.
me011: Mm-hmm.
fe008: Mm-hmm. I remember that.
me013: But, um, the attorneys, I - uh, I can guarantee you, the attorneys will always come back with - and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things, but they will always come back with saying that, um, you need to - you want to have someth- some paper trail or - which includes electronic trail - that they have, uh, in fact O K'd it.
me011: Mm-hmm.
me013: So, um, I think that if you f- i- if we send the email as you have and if there's half the people, say, who don't respond at all by, you know, some period of time, we can just make a list of these people and hand it to, uh - you know, just give it to me and I'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever, and they'll just call them up and say, you know, "have you -
me011: Right.
me013: Is - is this OK? And would you please mail - you know, mail Adam that it is, if i- if it, you know, is or not." So, you know, we can - we can do that.
fe016: The other thing that there's a psychological effect that - at least for most people, that if they've responded to your email saying "yes, I will do it" or "yes, I got your email", they're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it.
me013: Mm-hmm.
fe016: And of course we don't want them to bleep things out, but it - it's a little bit better if we're getting the - their, uh, final response, once they've answered you once than if they never answer you'd at al- at all. That's how these mailing houses work. So, I mean, it's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses.
fe008: Mm-hmm.
fe016: You know, an official OK from somebody is better than no answer, even if they responded that they got your email. And they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.
fe008: I also think they'd just simply appreciate it. I think it's a good - a good way of - of fostering goodwill among our subjects. Well, our participants.
me013: I think the main thing is - I mean, what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases. So they s- so - so - Tha- that's what they're paid to do.
me011: Sending lots of spam. Yep.
me013: And so, it is certainly possible that, uh, somebody's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually hear from us, and then they find this thing is in there and we've already distributed it to someone. So, what it says in there, in fact, is that they will be given an opportunity to blah-blah-blah,
fe008: Mm-hmm.
me013: but if in fact - if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason, um, then we haven't given them that.
me011: Well, so how far do we have to go? Do we need to get someone's signature? Or, is email enough? Do we have to have it notarized? I mean -
me013: I- i- i- em- email is enough.
me011: OK.
me013: Yeah. I mean, I've been through this - I mean, I'm not a lawyer, but I've been through these things a f- things f- like this a few times with lawyers now so I - I
me011: Mm-hmm.
me013: I- I'm pretty comfortable with that.
me018: Do you track, um, when people log in
me011: Uh. If they submit the form, I get it.
me018: to look at the - ? Uh-huh.
me011: If they don't submit the form, it goes in the general web log. But that's not sufficient.
me018: Hmm.
me011: Right? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't imply anything in particular.
me018: Except that you know they got the mail.
fe008: Mm-hmm. That's right. I - I could get you on the notify list if you want me to.
me011: Right. I'm already on it.
fe008: For that directory? OK, great.
me011: Mm-hmm.
me013: So again, hopefully, um, this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way, uh, in any of the extremes we've talked about because uh, we're talking a pretty small number of people.
me011: W- For this set, I'm not worried, because we basically know everyone on it.
me013: Mm-hmm.
fe008: Hmm.
me013: Mm-hmm.
me011: You know, they're all more or less here or it's - it's Eric and Dan and so on. But for some of the others, you're talking about visitors who are gone from ICSI,
me013: Mm-hmm.
me011: whose email addresses may or may not work,
fe008: Oh.
me013: Mm-hmm.
me011: and - So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?
fe008: I don't think, uh - They're so recent, these visitors. I - and - and I - they're also so -
me011: Mm-hmm.
me013: Mm-hmm.
fe008: They're prominent enough that they're easy to find through - I - I mean, I - I w- I'll be able to - if you have any trouble finding them, I really think I could find them.
me011: Other methods? OK.
me013: Yeah. Cuz it - what it - what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission. Um, and I think, you know, if you go into a room and close the door and - and ask their permission and they're not there, it doesn't seem that that's the intent of, uh, meaning here. So.
me011: Well, the qu- the question is just whether - how active it has to be. I mean, because they - they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.
me013: Right.
me011: And so far everyone has done email. There isn't anyone who did, uh, any other contact method.
me013: Well, the way ICSI goes, people, uh, who, uh, were here ten years ago still have acc- have forwards to other accounts and so on. So it's unusual that - that they, uh -
me011: Yeah. So my original impression was that that was sufficient, that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate
me013: Yeah.
fe016: Then they just come back.
me018: All my files were still here. Yeah.
me011: that we fulfilled our burden.
fe016: Same as us.
me013: So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it. But, you know, hopefully we won't need to.
fe008: I just -
me011: OK.
fe008: I d- I just don't think we will.
me011: Alright.
fe008: For all the reasons that we've discussed.
me013: So we'll - we'll see if we do or not.
me011: Yep. And we'll see how many people respond to that email.
fe008: Yeah.
me011: So far, two people have. So.
me013: Yeah. I think very few people will and - and - and, you know, people - people see long emails about things that they don't think is gonna be high priority, they typically, uh, don't - don't read it, or half read it.
me011: Right.
me013: Cuz people are swamped. But -
fe008: And actually, um, I - I - didn't anticipate this so I - that's why I didn't give this comment, and it - I - this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying "by the way, you know, we wanna hear back from you by X date and please -", and then add what Liz said - "please, uh, respond to - please indicate you received this mail."
me013: Uh, or e- well, maybe even additionally, uh, um, "Even if you've decided you have no changes you'd like to make, if you could
me011: Respond to the email. Yep.
me013: tell us that ". Yeah.
fe008: Mm-hmm. It is the first time through the cycle.
fe016: Right. That would - that would definitely work on me. You know, it makes you feel m- like, um, if you were gonna p- if you're predicting that you might not answer, you have a chance now to say that. Whereas, I - I mean, I would be much more likely myself, given all my email, t- to respond at that point, saying "you know what, I'm probably not gonna get to it" or whatever,
me018: And the other th-
fe016: rather than just having seen the email, thinking I might get to it, and never really,
me018: Yeah. I was -
fe016: uh, pushing myself to actually do it until it's too late.
me018: I was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this.
fe016: Right. R- Right. That's true.
me013: Right.
me018: I mean, I - I - Yeah. So that way they could - they can see from that email that if they just write back and say "I got it, no changes", they're off the hook. They don't have to go to the web page and -
me013: Yeah. I mean, the other thing I've learned from dealing with - dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth, uh, is, um,
fe016: Yeah. That's true.
me013: if you say "you've got three months to do this review", um, people do it, you know, two and seven eighths months from now. If you say "you've got three weeks to do this review", they do - do it, you know, two and seven eighths weeks from now - they do the review.
me011: Right.
me013: And, um - So, if we make it a little less time, I don't think it'll be that much -
me011: Well, and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth, that means we better give them deadline of the first, if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time.
me013: There's the responding part and there's also what if, uh, I mean, I hope this doesn't happen, what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes? Then
me011: Right.
me013: we actually have to deal with that if we want it to -
fe008: Mm-hmm. Some lead time.
me011: Ugh! Disk space, oh my god! I hadn't thought about that.
fe008: By the way, has - has Jeremy signed the form? OK.
me011: That for every meeting - any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of.
mn017: Oh.
me018: Just that channel. Oh, no. We have to do -
me001: Can't you just do that channel?
me011: No, of course not. You need all the channels.
fe016: Yeah. You have to do all of them,
me001: Oh.
fe016: as well as all of these.
me018: Do you have to do the other close-talking?
me001: Yeah.
me051: Wow.
me011: Yes. Absolutely. There's a lot of cross-talk.
fe016: You have to do all - You could just do it in that time period, though, but I guess it's a pain.
fe008: Well -
me011: Well, but you have to copy the whole file. Right? Because we're gonna be releasing the whole file.
fe016: Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
fe008: Well - I - you know, I think at a certain point, that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy.
me011: Yeah. It's just I hate deleting any data. So I - I don't want - I really would rather make a copy of it, rather than
me013: Are you del- are you bleeping it by adding?
me011: bleep it out and then - Overlapping. So, it's - it's exactly a censor bleep. So what I really think is "bleep" and then I want to -
me013: I- I- I- I understand, but is - is it summing signals or do you delete the old one and put the new one in?
me011: I delete the old one, put the new one in. There's nothing left of the original signal.
me013: Oh, OK. Cuz - Oh. Cuz if you were summing, you could - No. But anyway - Yeah.
me011: Yeah. It would be qui- quite easy to get it back again.
fe008: But - And then w- I was gonna say also that the- they don't have to stay on the system, as you know, cuz - cuz the - the ones -
fe016: Then someday we can sell the unedited versions.
me018: Yeah.
me011: Say again?
fe008: Once it's been successfully bleeped, can't you rely on the - ?
me018: Or we'll tell people the frequency of the beep and then they could subtract the beep out.
me013: Encrypt it.
me001: You can hide it. Yeah.
mn017: Oh, yeah.
fe008: Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version?
fe016: Right. Exactly. I see.
me011: Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yep, that's true.
me001: It wouldn't be that hard
fe016: See, this is good. I wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings. So -
me013: Yeah. You could encrypt it,
me001: to hide it.
fe008: OK.
me001: You can use spread spectrum. Hide it. Yeah, there you go.
me013: you know, with a - with a two hundred bit - thousand bit, uh -
me018: Uh-huh. Here we go.
fe016: Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we don't have enough asides.
mn017: I have an idea. You reverse the signal, so it - it lets people say what they said backwards.
me001: There you go. Then you have, like, subliminal, uh, messages, like.
me011: Backwards. But, ha- you've seen the - this - the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments. Did you read that paper?
mn017: Yeah.
me011: It wouldn't work. The speech recognizer still works.
mn017: No.
fe016: Yeah. And if you do it backward then -
me013: Yeah.
fe016: H- good old HMM. No, it's backward-forward.
me018: That's cuz they use forward-backward.
me011: Forward but backward. That's right. Good point. A point.
me013: Uh.
me011: Well, I'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing. It's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting a- on this and it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.
me013: Well, but we never also - we've also never done it.
fe008: Hmm.
fe016: Uh.
me011: So. Yeah.
fe016: If it makes -
me013: So.
fe008: This is the first cycle. There're bound to be some glitches the first time through.
me013: And, uh - and I'm sorry responding without, uh, having much knowledge, but the thing is, uh, I am, like, one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and - and stuff comes in as
me011: Well, and that's exactly why I did it the way I did it, which is the default is if you do nothing we're gonna release it. Because,
me013: Yeah.
me011: you know, I have my stack of emails of to d- to be done, that, you know, fifty or sixty long, and the ones at the top I'm never gonna get to.
me013: Right.
me011: And, uh So - so -
me018: Move them to the bottom.
me013: So - so the only thing we're missing is - is some way to respond to easily to say, uh, "OK, go ahead" or something. Yeah.
me011: Yeah, right. So, i- this is gonna mean -
me018: Just re-mail them to yourself and then they're at the bottom.
me011: Yeah. Yeah. That's actually definitely a good point. The m- email doesn't specify
fe008: Yeah.
me011: that you can just reply to the email, as op- as opposed to going to the form and -
mn017: In -
fe008: Mm-hmm.
fe016: Right.
fe008: And it also doesn't give a - a specific - I didn't think of it. S- I think it's a good idea - an ex- explicit time by which this will be considered
me011: Yeah, release.
fe008: definite. And - and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint.
me013: Yeah. It's converging.
mn017: This - um, I've seen this recently. Uh, I got email, and it -
fe008: Yeah. That's right.
mn017: i- if I use a MIME-capable mail reader, it actually says, you know, click on this button to confirm receipt of the - of the mail.
me001: Hmm.
fe008: Oh, that's interesting.
mn017: So -
me011: You - you can - A lot of mailers support return receipt. But it doesn't confirm that they've read it.
me001: It's like certified mail.
fe008: Could do that.
mn017: Right. No, no, no. This is different. This is not - So, I - I know, you can tell, you know, the, uh, mail delivery agent to - to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox. But - but, no. This was different.
fe008: Mmm.
me011: Right.
mn017: Ins- in the mail, there was a -
me011: Oh, just a button. Oh, yeah.
mn017: uh, th- there was a button that when you clicked on it, it would send, uh, you know, a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail.
me011: Yeah. Unfor- Yeah, we could do that. But I hate that.
mn017: But it o- but it only works for, you know, MIME-capable - you know, if you use Netscape or something like that for your n-
me011: Yeah.
fe016: You might as well just respond to the mail. I mean
me013: And - And we actually need a third thing. It's not that you've looked at it, it's that you've looked at it and - and - and agree with one of the possible actions. Right?
mn017: Right. No, no. You can do that. You know, you can put this button anywhere you want, and you can put it the bottom of the message and say "here, by - you know, by clicking on this, I - I agree -
me013: Oh? Oh, I see.
mn017: uh, you know, I acknowledge -"
me013: That i- i- my first-born children are yours, and - Yeah. Yeah.
fe016: Quick question. Are, um -
me011: Well, I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that. So.
fe008: But why shouldn't they just email back? I don't see there's a problem. It's very nice. I - I like the high-tech aspect of it, but I think -
me011: Yeah. Reply.
me013: Yeah.
mn017: Right.
me013: Yeah.
mn017: No, no, no. I actually don't. I'm just saying that
fe008: I appreciate it.
me011: Well, I - cuz I use a text mail reader.
mn017: if ev- but I'm -
fe016: Don't you use VI for your mai- ?
mn017: Yeah.
me013: Wow. That's - that's my guy. Alright.
me011: You - you read email in VI?
mn017: Yeah.
fe008: Yeah. I like VI.
mn017: So - I - i- There's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page, like "powered by VI".
me001: Yeah.
me013: Wow.
fe016: Anyway, quick question. How m-
me011: You could put wed bugs in the email.
me001: I see.
mn017: Yeah.
fe016: Like, there were three meetings this time, or so- or how many? Six?
fe008: Six.
fe016: But, no- of different people. So I guess if you're in both these types of meetings, you'd have a lot. But - How - I mean, it also depends on how many - Like, if we release - this time it's a fairly small number of meetings, but what if we release, like, twenty-five meetings to people?
me011: Well, what my s- expectation is, is that we'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.
fe016: In th- I don't know. Oh. Oh, OK. So this time was just the first chunk. OK.
me011: So. Tha- that was my intention. It's just - yeah - that we just happened to have a bunch all at once.
fe016: Well, that's a good idea.
me011: I mean, maybe - Is that the way it's gonna be, you think, Jane?
fe008: I agree with you. It's - we could do it, uh - I- I could - I'd be happy with either way, batch-wise - What I was thinking - Uh, so this one - That was exactly right, that we had a - uh, uh - I - I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready. Don't have it. But, uh, this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable. People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.
me013: Mm-hmm.
fe008: My, um - I was thinking that with the NSA meetings, I'd like - there are three of them, and they're - uh, I - I will have them done by Monday. Uh, unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that's gonna work out, but I thought it'd be good to have that released as a clump, too, because then, you know, they're - they - they have a - it- it's in a category, it's not quite so distracting to them, is what I was thinking, and it's all in one chu- But after that, when we're caught up a bit on this process, then, um, I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.
fe016: OK.
fe008: I could do it either way. I mean, it's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking.
me013: We heard anything from IBM? at all ?
me018: Uh. Let's see. We - Yeah, right. So we got the transcript back from that one meeting. Everything seemed fine. Adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was - Well, there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix. And then, um, we, uh - I sent him a pointer to three more. And so he's off and working on those.
me011: Yeah. Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting, to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff. So at some point we need to do that.
me018: Yeah.
fe008: That's on my list. Well, that's on my list.
me018: Yeah. It's gonna have to go through our regular
me011: I mean, the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels. There are a fair number of "yeahs" and "uh-huhs" that - it's just - that aren't in there.
me018: process.
me011: So.
fe008: Hmm.
me013: But I think - Yeah. Like you said, I mean, that's - that's gonna be our standard proc- that's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time doing, I would imagine, once - once we -
fe008: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
me011: Yes, absolutely. Yeah.
me013: It's gonna -
fe008: One question about the backchannels. Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre-segmenter?
me011: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
fe008: Oh, interesting. Oh, interesting. OK.
me011: Yeah. They're - they're not in the segmented. It's not that the IBM people didn't do it.
fe008: OK. OK.
me011: Just they didn't get marked.
fe008: OK. So maybe when the detector for that gets better or something - I w- I - There's another issue which is this - we've been, uh, contacted by University of Washington now, of course, to, um - We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings and they're downloading the audio files. So they'll be doing that. Chuck's - Chuck's, uh, put that in.
me018: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I pointed them to the set that Andreas put, uh, on the web so th- if they want to compare directly with his results they can. And, um, then once, uh, th- we can also point them at the, um, uh, the original meetings and they can grab those, too, with SCP.
fe016: Wait. So you put the reference files - ?
me018: No, no. They d- they wanted the audio. Jane sent them the, uh, transcripts.
fe016: Or the - ? No, I mean of the transcripts. Um. Well, we can talk about it off-line.
me011: There's another meeting in here, what, at four?
me018: Mm-hmm.
me011: Right? Yeah, so we have to finish by three forty-five.
mn017: D- d- So, does Washi- does - does UW wanna u- do this - wanna use this data for recognition or for something else?
me018: Uh, for recognition.
fe016: I think they're doing w- didn't they want to do language modeling on, you know, recognition-compatible transcripts or - ?
mn017: Oh. Oh. I see.
me013: Yeah.
fe008: This is to show you, uh, some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure. Um @@ So, this is from one of the NSA meetings and, uh, i- if you're familiar with the diff format, the arrow to the left is what it was, and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to. So, um. And now the first one. "OK. So, then we started a weekly meeting. The last time, uh -" And the transcriber thought "little too much" But, uh, @@ really, um, it was "we learned too much", which makes more sense syntactically as well.
mn017: And these - the parentheses were f- from -
fe008: Then - Oh, this - that's the convention for indicating uncertain. So the transcriber was right.
me011: U- uncertains.
mn017: S-
fe008: You know, she was uncertain about that. So she's right to be uncertain.
mn017: OK. Oh. OK.
fe008: And it's also a g- a good indication of the - of that. The next one. This was about, uh, Claudia and she'd been really b- busy with stuff, such as waivers. Uh, OK. Um, next one. Um. This was an interesting one. So the original was "So that's not - so Claudia's not the bad master here", and then he laughs, but it really "web master".
me011: Web master.
me001: Oh. Uh-oh.
fe008: And then you see another type of uncertainty which is, you know, they just didn't know what to make out of that.
me011: Yep.
fe008: So instead of "split upon unknown", it's "split in principle".
me001: Jane, these are from IBM? The top lines?
me011: Spit upon?
fe008: No, no. These are - these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings. The transcribers - transcriber's version ver- versus the checked version.
me011: No, these are ours.
me001: Oh. Oh, I see.
fe008: My - my checked version, after I go through it.
me001: OK.
fe008: Um, then you get down here. Um. Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms. That's the next example, the next one. The, uh, version beyond this is - So instead of saying "or", especially those words, " also" and "oder" and some other ones. Those sneak in. Um, the next one -
mn017: Discourse markers.
me011: That's cool.
mn017: Discourse markers.
fe008: S- Sorry, what?
mn017: Discourse markers. Yeah. Yeah.
fe008: Discourse markers? Sure. Sure, sure, sure. And it's - and it makes sense cuz it's, like, below this - it's a little subliminal there.
mn017: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
fe008: Um. OK, the next one, uh, this is a term. The problem with terminology. Description with th- the transcriber has "X as an advance". But really it's "QS in advance". I mean, I - I've benefited from some of these, uh, cross-group meetings. OK, then you got, um, uh, instead of "from something-or-other cards", it's "for multicast". And instead of " ANN system related", it's " end system related". This was changed to an acronym initially and it should- shouldn't have been. And then, you can see here "GPS" was misinterpreted. It's just totally understanda- This is - this is a lot of jargon. Um, and the final one, the transcriber had th- "in the core network itself or the exit unknown, not the internet unknown". And it - it comes through as "in the core network itself of the access provider, not the internet backbone core ". Now this is a lot of terminology.
mn017: Mmm.
fe008: And they're generally extremely good, but, you know in this - this area it really does pay to, um - to double check and I'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see s- substantial improvements in performance cuz the - you know, there're a lot of these in there.
mn017: Yeah. So how often - ?
me011: Yeah, but I bet - I bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway, though.
me001: Mmm.
fe008: No, actually no. Huh-uh.
me011: Oh, really? Uh, it's - Oh, so it's just jargon.
fe008: It's jargon. Yeah. I mean this is - cuz, you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top-down influences in what you're hearing.
mn017: Well, but -
fe008: And it's jar- it's jargon coupled with a foreign accent.
mn017: But - but - But we don't - I mean, our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow. So, you know, un- until you actually get a decent language model, @@ Adam's right. You probably won't notice a difference.
me013: Yeah.
me011: It probably won't do any better.
mn017: But it's - I mean, it's definitely good that these are fixed. I mean, obviously.
fe008: Well, also from the standpoint of getting people's approval, cuz if someone sees a page full of
me013: Yeah.
fe008: uh, um, barely decipherable w- you know, sentences, and then is asked to approve of it or not, it's, uh, uh -
me011: Did I say that?
me013: Yeah. Yeah. That would be a shame if people said "well, I don't approve it because the - it's not what I said". Yeah.
fe008: OK.
me011: Well, that's exactly why I put the extra option in,
fe008: Exactly. That's why we discussed that.
me011: is that I was afraid people would say, "let's censor that because it's wrong ", and I don't want them to do that.
me013: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
fe008: And then I also - the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain in the originals.
mn017: C-
fe008: And - and they very much appro- they mu- much prefer the new ones, and actually I - I mean, I - I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the - the choice. We'd originally chosen, uh,
me011: Yeah.
fe008: very expensive head- headsets but, um, they're just not as good as these, um,
me011: Ugh!
fe008: in this - with this respect to this particular task.
mn017: Well, return the old ones.
me011: It's probably impedance matching problems. But -
fe008: I don't know exactly, but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription. So it i- we had every reason to think they would work. Sorry, what?
me013: Could be.
me011: Mm-hmm.
mn017: So you have spare headsets? You have spare headsets?
me011: They're just earphones. They're not headsets. They're not microphones.
mn017: No, no. I mean, just earphones?
fe016: Right.
mn017: Um, because I, uh, I could use one on my workstation, just to t- because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b- go borrow it from someone and -
fe008: We have actua- actually I have - W- Well, the thing is, that if we have four people come to work for a day, I was - I was hanging on to the others
mn017: Oh, OK.
fe008: for, eh - for spares, but I can tell you what I recommend.
me013: No, but you'd - If you - Yeah, w- we should get it.
mn017: Sure. No problem. I just -
me011: But if you need it, just get it. Come on.
mn017: Right.
me013: Yeah. If you need it. Yeah.
mn017: Yeah.
me013: They're - they're - they're - they're pretty inexpensive. Yeah.
me001: Yeah, I still - I still need to get a pair, too.
fe008: It'd just have to be a s- a separate order - an added order.
fe016: Yeah, that - We should order a cou- uh, t-
me001: I'm using one of these. Yeah.
fe016: two or three or four, actually. We have -
mn017: I think I have a pair that I brought from home, but it's f- just for music listening and it's not - Nnn. Yeah.
me013: No. Just - just - just - just buy them.
fe016: Sh- Just get the model number and - Where do you buy these from? Like - ?
me013: Just buy them.
mn017: Yeah.
fe008: Cambridge SoundWorks, just down the street.
fe016: You just b- go and b- Oh.
fe008: Yeah. They always have them in stock.
me013: Yeah.
mn017: Anyway.
fe016: That'd be a good idea.
me011: W- uh, could you email out the brand?
me013: Yeah.
fe008: Oh, sure. Yeah. OK.
me011: Cuz I think - sounds like people are interested. So.
me001: Yeah. Definitely.
me013: Yeah.
fe008: It's made a difference in - in how easy. Yeah.
me013: I realized something I should talk about. So what's the other thing on the agenda actually ?
me011: Uh, the only one was Don wanted to, uh, talk about disk space yet again.
me001: Yeah. u- It's short. I mean, if you wanna go, we can just throw it in at the end.
me013: No, no. Why don't you - why don't you go ahead since it's short.
me001: Um, well, uh.
me011: Oh, I thought you meant the disk space. Yeah, we know disk space is short.
mn017: The disk space was short. Yeah. That's what I thought too.
fe016: That's a great ambiguity.
me013: Yeah.
fe016: It's one of these - it's - it's social and, uh, discourse level and -
me013: It's -
me001: Yeah.
me013: I- i- i- it- i- Yeah, it's great. Yeah, double - double -
fe016: Sorry. See, if I had that little scratch-pad, I would have made an X there.
me011: Yeah, it was really goo-
me001: Thank you, thank you.
me011: Uh, well, we'll give you one then.
me013: Yeah.
me001: Um. So, um, without thinking about it, when I offered up my hard drive last week -
me011: Oh, no.
fe016: It was while I was out of town.
me001: Um, this is always a suspect phrase. But, um, no. I, uh - I realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments, um, o- for this, uh, paper we're writing, so we're probably gonna need a lot more - We're probably gonna need that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive. But, um, we also have someone else coming in that's gonna help us out with some stuff. So -
me013: We've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.
fe016: I think we need, like, another eighteen gig disk to be safe.
me001: OK. We just need to -
me013: Well, we're getting three thirty - thirty-sixes.
fe016: So.
me001: OK.
me013: Right? That are going into the main f- file server. So.
fe016: OK.
me018: Markham's ordering and they should be coming in soon.
me001: W- Well. So - so -
me011: Soon?
me001: Yeah. I mean, I guess the thing is is, all I need is to hang it off, like, the person who's coming in, Sonali's, computer.
mn017: Oh, so - so, you mean the d- the internal - the disks on the machines that we just got?
me001: Whew. Or we can move them.
me011: No.
mn017: Or extra disk?
me018: These are gonna go onto Abbott.
me011: Ne- new disks.
me013: Onto Abbott, the file server.
me001: So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in? OK. That's fine.
mn017: Oh, oh. OK.
me011: On - Yeah. Once they come in. Sure.
fe016: Uh, i- Do - when - when is this planned for roughly?
me018: They should be - I - I imagine next week or something.
fe016: OK. So -
me011: If you're - if you're desperate, I have some space on my drive.
me001: OK. I think if I'm -
me011: But I - I vacillate between no space free and a few gig free. So.
fe016: Yeah.
me001: Yeah. I think I can find something if I'm desperate and, um, in the meantime I'll just hold out. That was the only thing I wanted to bring up.
me011: OK.
me018: It should be soon. We - we should -
me001: OK.
me013: So there's another hundred gig. So.
me001: Alright. Great.
mn017: Mm-hmm.
me013: OK. It's great to be able to do it, just say "oh yeah, a hundred gig, no big deal".
me001: That's it.
fe016: Good.
me001: Yeah.
me011: Yeah. A hundred gig here, a hundred gig there. It's eventually
fe016: Well, each meeting is like a gig or something, so it's really -
me013: Yeah.
me011: real disk space.
me013: Yeah. Um. Yeah. I was just going to comment that I- I'm going to, uh, be on the phone with Mari tomorrow, late afternoon. We're supposed to
me011: Oh, yeah.
me013: get together and talk about, uh, where we are on things. Uh, there's this meeting coming up, uh, and there's also an annual report. Now, I never actually - I - I was asking about this. I don't really quite understand this. She was re- she was referring to it as - I think this actually didn't just come from her, but this is what, uh, DARPA had asked for. Um, she's referring to it as the an- annual report for the fiscal year. But of course the fiscal year starts in October, so I don't quite understand w- w- why we do an annual report that
me018: She's either really late or really early.
me013: we're writing in July.
me011: Huh. Or she's getting a good early start.
me013: Uh, I think basically it- it's none of those. It's that the meeting is in July so they - so DARPA just said do an annual report. So. So. So anyway, I'll be putting together stuff. I'll do it, uh, you know, as much as I can without bothering people, just by looking at - at papers and status reports. I mean, the status reports you do are very helpful.
mn017: Hmm.
me013: Uh, so I can grab stuff there. And if, uh - if I have some questions I'll -
me011: When we remember to fill them out.
me013: Yeah. If people could do it as soon as - as you can, if you haven't done one si- recently. Uh. Uh, but, you know, I'm - I'm sure before it's all done, I'll end up bugging people for - for more clarification about stuff. Um. But, um, I don't know, I guess - I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing. We have these meetings and - and there's the status reports. Uh. But, um. Um. Yeah. So that wasn't a long one. Just to tell you that. And if something hasn't, uh - I'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon, and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it's important thing to mention on this kind of thing, uh, uh, just pop me a one-liner and - and - and I'll - I'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.
mn017: OK.
me013: Uh. I guess, uh, you- you're still pecking away at the demos and all that, probably.
me011: Yep. And Don is gonna be helping out with that. So.
me013: Oh, that's right. OK.
me011: Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon?
me001: Um.
me011: Not here, but later today?
me001: We should probably talk off-line about when we're gonna talk off-line.
me011: OK. OK.
me013: OK. Yeah, I might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz, um, I'm actually gonna have a - a few days off the following week, a- after the - after the picnic. So.
me011: Oh, OK.
me013: That's all I had.
me011: So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription - automatic transcription, but we're kind of running late. So.
fe016: How long does it take you to save the data?
me011: Fifteen minutes. So.
fe016: Yeah.
me011: If you wanna do a quick
fe016: Yeah.
me011: ten minute -
fe016: Guess we should stop, like, twenty of at the latest. We - we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record. So.
me013: Uh - And there's the digits to do. So maybe - may- maybe - maybe - We could.
me011: Yeah. Well, we can skip the digits.
me013: Fi- five minute report or something.
fe016: It's up to you. I don't -
me013: Yeah, yeah. Well, I would love to hear about it, especially since -
me011: Whatever you want. What do you have to say? I'm interested, so -
me013: Yeah. Well, I'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow, so this is just a good example of the sort of thing I'd like to hear about.
fe016: Wait. Why is everybody looking at me?
me011: Sorry.
me018: I don't know.
me013: Cuz he looked at you and says you're sketching.
mn017: What?
fe016: Uh. I'm not sure what you were referring to.
fe008: Who's - ?
mn017: I - I - I - I'm not - actually, I'm not sure what - ? Are we supposed to have done something?
me011: No. We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting.
mn017: Oh. Alternating.
fe016: Uh-huh.
me011: And this week we were gonna try to do t- automatic transcription status.
fe016: I wasn't here last week. Sorry.
mn017: Oh!
fe016: Oh.
mn017: We did that last week. Right?
me011: But we sort of failed.
fe016: Hhh.
me011: No.
me013: I thought we did.
me011: Did we? OK.
mn017: Yeah. We did.
me011: OK. So now - now we have the schedule. So next week we'll do automatic transcription status, plus anything that's real timely.
mn017: OK.
fe016: Oh. OK.
fe008: OK.
me013: OK. Whew!
me011: Whew!
me018: Good update.
fe016: Sorry.
me013: That was -
me011: Dodged that bullet.
me013: Yeah. Nicely done, Liz.
fe008: A woman of few words.
me013: But - but lots of prosody. OK. OK.
mn017: Uh, I mean, we - we really haven't done anything.
me011: Th- Excuse me?
mn017: Sorry.
fe008: Well, since last week.
fe016: Yeah, we're -
mn017: I mean, the - the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the, um - the automatic alignments because, uh, I got some - @@ I - I - I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech - or, of the foreground speech with background speech. So.
me011: Yeah.
mn017: But, we haven't actually -
fe016: And then, uh, I guess, the new data that Don will start to process - the, um - when he can get these - You know, before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems because you have
mn017: Mmm.
me011: Oh. Right, right.
fe016: timed sp- at - on either side.
me011: Mm-hmm.
fe016: And so that's sort of a stage-two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step.
me011: Right.
fe008: I'll be interested.
fe016: We did get our, um - I guess, good news. We got our abstract accepted for this conference, um - workshop, ISCA workshop, in, um, uh, New Jersey. And we sent in a very poor abstract, but they - very poor, very quick. Um, but we're hoping to have a paper for that as well, which should be an interesting -
me011: When's it due?
fe016: The t- paper isn't due until August. The abstracts were already due. So it's that kind of workshop.
me011: Mm-hmm.
fe016: But, I mean, the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in prosody - sort of a different crowd, and I think we're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far, so that should be interesting.
fe008: What's the name of the meeting?
fe016: Uh, it's
mn017: It's called Prosody to -
fe016: ISCA Workshop on Prosody in Speech Recognition and Understanding, or something like that - some generic -
me011: Mm-hmm.
fe008: Good.
fe016: Uh, so it's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there's a - um, a web page
me013: Y- you going to, uh, Eurospeech?
fe016: for it.
mn017: Yeah.
me013: Yeah.
me011: I don't have a paper but I'd kinda like to go, if I could. Is that alright?
me013: We'll discuss it. My - my - my car - my car needs a good wash, by the way.
me011: OK. I guess that's "no".
fe016: Funny @@
me011: OK. Well, that th- Hey, if that's what it takes, that's fine with me.
me013: Um.
me011: I'll pick up your dry-cleaning, too.
me013: Right.
me011: Should we do digits?
me013: Yeah.
me011: Uh.
mn017: Can I go next? Because I have to leave, actually.
me011: Yep. Go for it. Hmm! Thanks. Thank you.
me013: So you get to be the one who has all the paper rustling. Right?
fe008: Yeah, exactly! I mean, with the distractions, I was having trouble focusing. But.
