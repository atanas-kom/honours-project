me051: Mm-hmm.
me011: And we're on.
mn014: Time?
me011: So, uh -
mn014: Fourteen whatever.
me011: So, topic number one is, we got the NSF ATR - ITR , excuse me, which was originally pretty big, but it's divided among many sites, and they, like, cut the budget by a th- by two thirds. So they - they approved it for all the sites, but only gave us like sixty-two percent of the money. Or, excuse me, cut it by sixty-two percent.
mn014: Thirty-two. Yeah. Thirty. Whatever.
me011: So, uh, Morgan is, uh - And the other condition is that they have to get a budget out, like, immediately, or the- or they'll give the money to someone else. So Morgan's working on that.
me018: By next Friday.
me001: Hmm.
me011: So, I mean, it's good news. It's not as good as it could have been but it was, uh -
me018: It's more money.
me011: The - the ITRs are, you know, a - a - long shot, and so it's - it's really nice that we got that.
me001: What does that stand for?
me011: Information Technology Research? Something like that?
me018: Something like that.
me051: Hmm.
me001: Alright.
me011: It's, uh -
mn014: Doesn't say much.
me001: Yeah, it's pretty vague. It's government-run, I guess.
me018: It's - it's um, it's some money that we can use - Uh, I mean, we're in conjunction with uh, SRI, Washington, and, um, Columbia.
me001: Mm-hmm. OK.
me018: And to do research on the meetings.
me001: Cool.
me011: Yeah, it was specifically on the meeting.
mn014: Not great.
me011: So, d- was that the one that was the meeting maps?
me018: Yeah.
me011: OK, good. I liked that one.
me018: Yeah.
mn014: What is meet- meeting maps?
me018: Mapping meetings, or - ?
me011: Well, the - the sort of general idea was, you can think about meetings at lots of different levels, all the way d- from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue, discourse, topic.
mn014: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
me011: And so this - this was, how do you map all that information onto that?
me018: It's like creating a m- a map of a meeting, in a sense.
me011: a- onto the meeting domain. So that the - the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions. And so, uh,
mn014: Uh, OK.
me011: So this had a lot of different stuff in it.
mn014: OK.
me018: It actually doesn't have a whole lot of - m- speech stuff to it. It's -
mn014: Yeah. Sure.
me011: It's mostly higher level.
mn014: Yeah, that's - Yeah.
me018: Higher level, yeah.
me011: Yeah.
mn014: Yeah.
me011: But, nonetheless, I think if we - It's a - it's a cool idea. And if we can actually get it - get it going that would be neat. So - And uh, this was the one also that was, uh, Was it with Susan Ervin-Tripp?
me018: I don't remember. It might have been. Yeah. We had to get some -
mn014: With who?
me011: She's a linguist on campus.
mn014: OK.
me011: Anyway. So, other topics I wanted to talk about are, um, the DARPA demo which, I guess, since Morgan isn't here we can't really talk about. I just wanted to make sure it was ready to go.
me001: Yeah.
me011: Uh, but I guess -
me001: I sent -
me011: Your stuff is all ready so it's just a question of, did Morgan get around to testing it.
me001: Yeah, and I sent you an email
me011: Yeah, I got it. With the instructions.
me001: with the instructions. I don't know. So, Morgan - I guess Morgan's leaving on Saturday?
me011: Yep.
me001: So until then, I guess we might hear something, but -
me011: Yeah, so I guess we ge- we had better be on call for a little while.
me001: Yeah, exactly.
me018: Did he ever figure out how to d- switch between applications like he was wanting to do?
me011: I don't know. I haven't spoken with him.
me001: Yeah.
me018: He did?
me001: Oh- Yeah.
mn014: Switch between applications?
me018: How is he gonna do it?
me001: It's just Alt Tab.

mn014: Yes, that's -
me011: I - I think -
me018: he -

me011: Actually, both of them. You know, cuz we're gonna wanna be playing with the -
me001: Mm-hmm.
me011: uh - help, my brain - with the uh,
me001: Prosody?
me011: prosody stuff anyway. Um, so, actually, at some point w- we should talk to users of that technology who are actually gonna be using it and see what they would like to see.
me001: Yeah, have you guys seen the display? Have you guys seen either of the demos? They're pretty cool, like -
me018: No.
mn014: Nope.
me001: the prosody demo, we basically w- loaded up um, word alignments. So, instead of having um, utterances in the bottom, it's like just word by word.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me001: So you can see exactly where the overlaps are. And then, um, Adam did something where, um, we converted these feature files into wave files,
me018: Oh.
me001: so you can display them.
me018: Display the features.
mn014: Instead of the wave file?
me001: Yeah. Instead of the wave file. And then w- using multi-wave you can add a file and play that sound.
mn014: Oh. OK.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me001: Play the audio corresponding to that, um, um, feature file, and it's all like, aligned and stuff.
mn014: OK. Ah, great.
me018: So you see, like, the Fzero contour?
me001: Yeah, so you see the pitch contours and you - and when you hit play, like there's a line that goes through it, you know, and it's all aligned with like the t-
me018: Mm-hmm.
me001: the audio and the -
mn014: Oh, that's great.
me011: Audio.
mn014: Yeah.
me011: And the stylized Fnaught features are pretty cool.
me001: feature file.
me018: Hmm.
me001: Yeah.
me011: So, these - this- it's- does a piece-wise linear and so, normally if you look at an Fnaught track, it jumps all over the place.
me018: Yeah.
mn014: Yeah.
me011: This is a nice smooth one and it really does a good job.
mn014: And - there's something like a median filter in it? or something? And uh, and it's - it's a linear fit or whatever. Yeah.
me018: Oh, neat.
me011: It's a combination.
me001: Yeah, there's a - Yeah. @@ There's a median filtering and then there's a piece-wise linear fit,
mn014: Yeah.
me001: based on some criteria. I'm not sure.
mn014: OK.
me011: Uh, t- G- Actually could you email me a reference to that paper? If you have it? Cuz I'm sorta curious how - what criteria it has.
me001: Yeah, sure. I should email Morgan about it too, because he was asking about that. And - Yeah.
me011: I mean, so, there's obviously a trade-off between the number of knots y- you pick, and the best fit. I mean, so, if you're doing a piece-wise linear,
mn014: Yeah.
me011: you have to figure out how many pieces you want.
mn014: Yeah. Sure.
me011: And so there's a trade-off because the best - the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots.
me001: Right, well, then it's not a linear f- fit. You're not fitting anything then.
mn014: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
me011: Well, sure it is. But
me001: Well -
mn014: Yeah.
me001: Yeah. It -
me011: So - so you - There's a trade-off and I'm wondering what criteria they use.
me001: It's kind of a useless one. Yeah, I actually don't know off the top of my head.
me011: Mm-hmm.
me018: Was this code that you downloaded to do this? Or was it -
me001: This was um, Kemal Sonmez at SRI,
me018: Hmm.
me001: who's a co-worker with, uh, Liz.
me011: Dot com.
me018: At SRI dot com?
me001: Yeah. Did I just -
me011: No, I - you said "at SRI" so I had to add the "dot com".
me018: No, i- It sounded like a URL, the way you were saying it, yeah.
me001: Oh. Oh. Sorry. Um, yeah, but, so Kamal has, uh - He did a paper on this for some v- speech verification, uh, project, and we basically e- extrapolated what he - what he did for that work and applied it to our files. And that's how we do - That's how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody.
me018: So what I mean is, like - the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here? Or you grabbed code from somewhere else?
me001: That - No, we grabbed most of it. Like, we grabbed the linear fitting stuff. We did all the alignments and
me018: Ah. I see. Mm-hmm.
me001: all the matching and stuff, but the actual coding of the -
mn014: And - And the-
me001: the math was done somewhere else.
mn014: These are our Fzero candidates which I'm supposed to use for the synthesis thing? I suppose?
me001: Uh, so that's what you were working on, right?
me051: Right. That's the same software I used to get the data.
mn014: Yeah. OK. OK.
me051: I - I gave you a c- couple examples, and -
mn014: Yeah, I m- didn't have time to - to look at that, so.
me011: Hmm.
me051: Right. Right.
mn014: Yeah.
me011: So, other topic is, uh, the IBM transcription status stuff. So we've sent a few to them. We've gotten a few back. Um, I sorta wish Jane was - were here because I think she gave - Didn't she give one of them to one of the transcribers?
me018: Yeah, it's done now.
me011: And, how was it?
me018: She said it was much faster. It really helped a lot to have that.
me011: Great.
me018: So, um, you know, there were a l-
mn014: Much faster than doing everything alone. OK.
me011: Hand.
me018: From scratch. Yeah. So -
me001: From end to en- Like, from the beginning of the process to the end of the process?
me018: No, f- no. So from the point where we s- take it, it's faster.
me011: Well, but that's what we wanted.
mn014: Yeah.
me001: Ooo. Yeah.
me011: Right. We knew it would be longer to have multiple groups.
me018: @@ u- So it's sorta like doing things in parallel. You know? So if,
me001: Yeah, right.
me011: Right.
me018: you know, if they can be working on that while we're working on the other things, then when we get them in,
me011: Well, pipelined.
me001: Mm-hmm.
me018: they don't have to do that one from scratch, basically.
me001: Right.
me011: The idea is that we're taking less time of the linguists. Of the transcribers. So.
me001: Right. S-
me018: Yeah, th- Right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from IBM, part- There's - there's several problems. One is, um, we were giving them these large files, which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes.
mn014: Fff!
me018: So either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes, so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them.
me001: Oh. Well
me018: So one of the things that we did is, Adam made a modification to th- his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want, uh, basically, uh, chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty-five minutes.
me001: Mm-hmm.
me018: And then we can give those to IBM and it'll make it easier for them to put them on tape. Um, then the other thing is that these - pool of transcribers that they're using, um, sort of are not dedicated to - to our project, but are in use for all IBM projects, and IBM has recently giving - given them uh, a whole bunch of stuff. So it's gonna, sort of delay us.
me011: We might wanna revisit hiring our own external transcription company. Because I think that would be cheaper than having our people do it, but do it with the same process with these beep files.
me018: Hmm, that's an interesting idea.
me011: I mean, cuz, originally I had disc- discounted that because it was just gonna be too hard. But now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out.
me018: Yeah. So the only difference would be, we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM .
me011: Then maybe it would be OK.
mn014: Yeah.
me011: Yep.
me018: And then we could send - If - if we had that process down, of putting the audio onto tape, we can send IBM the tapes or we can send this transcription place the tape-
me011: And we might wanna do that anyway. Because it seems like that's being a bottleneck and that's silly. It shouldn't be a bottleneck.
me018: Yeah.
me011: I mean - It would - Once we got it set up it w- it -
me018: Well, u- u- So, I don't know where the bottleneck was. Was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks? or was it actually putting it onto the tape?
me011: It may well have been partially that, you know, because they tried it, and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps, and go forward in the file, et cetera, et cetera. But, uh,
me018: Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
me011: it just seems like - it's not hard for us to do, and that would just make things go faster.
me018: Yeah, so how do we do that? How would we put -
me011: Get a tape deck,
mn014: Yeah.
me018: Yeah.
me011: plug it in to the computer, hit record,
mn014: Plug it into the sound card.
me011: on the tape deck,
mn014: Yeah.
me011: and just do it all - all uh,
me018: So plug i- So, like, the headphone output in the back of the computer?
me011: analog. Well, line out.
mn014: Line out, yeah.
me018: Line-out into the line-in on a tape player, and -
me011: Mm-hmm.
me001: Hmm.
mn014: Yep.
me018: Oh! Well, that sounds pretty easy.
me011: So - I mean, that's the easy way. They might have a more complex set-up at IBM. I've seen digital - digital analog tapes where it's controlled by the computer.
mn014: Yeah, but -
me018: Mmm.
mn014: The easy way is - Yeah. I know. No. Yeah.
me011: But w- But we don't need to do that. The - the disadvantage of doing it this way is it's real time. So you would have to sit there for an hour while it's recording.
me018: Yeah. But if it was at your desk or something -
me011: But -
mn014: Yeah, but you - Yeah. Pfff. Yeah.
me011: Right. It's not a big deal.
me001: So, what's the turn around period right now from IBM?
me018: Well, they - There was - OK. So th-
me001: Should we be discussing this, uh
me018: They, um, they gave - They've given us - Since we started doing this new, uh, beep format with "beep number beep",
me001: Mm-hmm.
me018: they've given us, uh, I think, two full, uh, transcripts. They have a third one and Brian just sent me a note saying "oh, that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their tr- of the eh - transcriptionists', uh, s- company".
me001: Mmm.
me018: And so there's gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back. And I've already given him three more to work on, but he said those new three
me001: OK.
me018: won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company.
me001: OK. And the transcribers here are still, uh - are working, though.
me018: Yeah. Yeah, they're working away.
me001: Th- they're just doing their own thing, like, while they're waiting. OK.
me018: They're just doing - Right, right. So what we do is, uh, when I go to um, select meetings for IBM, I go into the um - well, into the - the, uh, master sheet here with the statuses and I pick ones that Thilo has, um, pre-segmented, and I change the status to "Trans-IP IBM",
me011: Master.
me001: Mm-hmm.
me018: so that, you know, when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those. And, um - So I'm not picking
me011: So -
me018: huge chunks, right now, of meetings
me011: We should at least ask, um,
me018: for them, but -
me001: Mm-hmm.
me011: Brian if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape. Is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that?
me018: Mm-hmm. That's a good idea.
me011: And, uh - And then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us. I mean the o- the other problem is you would wanna r- do it on an unloaded machine. Right? Because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering.
mn014: Yep.
me018: Yeah.
mn014: Yeah. Yeah.
me018: Huh.
me011: And that means - That - that's more of a problem because y- then you have to be there.
mn014: And all - Yeah. And all of the PCs are connected to the network, too, here. Or, uh, bad .
me001: What i-
me011: Right.
me001: You're just talking about playing it - and - recording it, like, real-time?
me011: Yep.
me001: Oh.
me018: So when that thing - When it stutters like that, is it because there's a delay getting the data off a disk? Or is it because there's a delay in the D to A?
me011: Mm-hmm. It could be either. I mean, there are lots of different places. It can be delay on the disk, or it can be just load
me018: OK.
me011: gets high on the machine.
me018: Yeah.
me011: Um, either IO load or processor load.
me018: I see.
me011: You know, it's a problem with these multi-user systems is that lots of processes are running and you don't t- really have control.
me018: Maybe we could do it from a w- a PC or something.
me011: Wha-
mn014: Yeah. But they are also on the networks, so.
me018: Yeah.
me051: If you used a line out, too, you have to worry about if you click around and you
mn014: Maybe.
me051: hit a beep or something.
me011: That's true. It'll - That's right. So you really do wanna be using a machine that's not -
me051: It'll beep onto - onto the tape too.
me018: Hmm. Mmm.
me001: And you have to record every channel separately.
me011: No, because we're doing the beep files.
me018: Well, you know, I - I think David might have a bunch of o- old PCs, cuz he's replacing them with these new ones. Maybe we could get one,
mn014: The beep files.
me001: Oh, OK.
me018: and just dedicate it to doing this. Not even hook it u- Well, I guess we need to hook it to the network so we can get the files to it, but
me001: We -
me011: Yep.
me018: Uh,
me011: Or you could just - You could have it - no active connection. Just SCP them.
me018: Yeah. Right. And then just use that machine to hook up to the tape.
me011: Actually, it wouldn't be bad to have that, plus put on that machine a CD burner.
mn014: Yep.
me018: Yeah. We don't need a powerful machine to do these things, right? So, one of these old
me011: No.
me018: Pentiums that we have - Hmm. Should talk to him about that.
mn014: Or even a DVD burner.
me011: A DVD burner, yeah.
me001: Hmm.
me011: I guess the real question is, where would we put it and who would do it? I guess whoever records the meeting. I mean, it- it's not a big deal, but it's yet another thing you have to do.
me018: Yeah, yeah. That's why I wanted to avoid having to do that if we could, but - It's just another -
me001: They couldn't use CDs?
me011: No, because the transcription company does what they do.
me018: They have a um - a device that, you put the cassette in and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that. So.
me001: Oh, I see. I see.
me018: I guess they haven't
me011: Actually there are a few - I saw a web-based one at one point.
me018: got a p-
mn014: Web-based?
me011: Where you could send them audio files over the web and they send you back text files over the web. I should look that up again.
me018: Really! Y- can you send them huge audio files?
me011: Mmm. Mmm.
mn014: You can, but
me018: Yeah.
me011: I assume that you can send them anything that they can access
mn014: they never will be able to read them.
me018: Huh!
me011: with HTTP.
me018: That's interesting.
me001: Well, they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they're transcribing, anyway.
mn014: Yeah.
me001: I mean -
me018: Well, that's true.
me001: People probably aren't sending them, you know - an utterance or two.
me018: Are - How big are these files that we send to Brian?
mn014: Uh , pfff!
me011: Half a gig.
me018: @@ Really? That big?
me011: Oh, no, wait. They're the beep files. Yeah, it's a p- hundred meg. They're the beep files. That's right. So they're smaller.
me018: I thought it was, like, a hundred megs. Yeah. Hmm. That's still pretty dang big.
me011: Yes.
mn014: Send it via email.
me018: Yeah.
me011: And we are sending them the compressed ones, right?
me018: I don't know. Wha- whatever you generate. Yeah, the last ones you did were compressed.
me011: Yeah. Were "shortened". Yeah.
me018: Yeah. Wonder if the ones before that were shortened.
me011: Yeah. The beep files, actually - the "shorten" doesn't save a whole lot. Right? Because the whole point is that it's extracting pie- pars- parts that are loud anyway.
me018: Cuz it's all -
mn014: It's all speech. Yeah. Yeah.
me018: Mmm.
me011: So.
me018: Hmm!
me011: I think it only saves, like, half. Only.
mn014: Only.
me011: OK. So I think we just gotta let things slide for now, and see -
me018: Hmm! Yeah.
me011: see what's gonna happen. Nothing else really to do. Um, We have new equipment that I'm gonna try to set up tomorrow. New wireless.
me018: What will that do? Is that going to - ?
me011: And so, uh - Give us a couple more wireless channels.
me018: Oh, so we can get rid of the uh -
me011: Yep.
me018: Oh! That'll be nice.
me011: Yep. But it involves rewiring. And so, if I could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon
me018: I should be around.
me011: to help my brain. You know, just have someone to bounce the instructions off of and make sure I don't do anything too stupid.
mn014: Yeah, sure.
me011: Did I have another topic on the - on the list?
me018: Experiments?
me001: Isn't that next week?
mn014: Experiments? Yeah.
me011: That's -
me018: Yeah, I guess that's probably next. Yeah.
me011: Wha- what did I have on the agenda I mailed out?
mn014: These are next week.
me001: I think it was - Oh yeah, I don't know.
mn014: The demo? Demo and IBM, I think.
me018: Something about -
me001: The demo was one of them.
me018: Demo.
me011: Yeah, that's it. That was it.
mn014: Yeah.
me001: Yeah. I think that's it.
mn014: Yeah.
me018: Yeah.
mn014: Short meeting?
me018: Yeah.
me011: Short meeting? Does anyone have anything else?
me018: Oh, I made a - Oh, but that's not specific to Meeting Recorder. I was gonna say I took some - a suggestion of Adam's, and I, um, created a m- CGI script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks.
me001: Mm-hmm.
me018: So if you go to the speech local web page, and then there's a disk status page. You can click on that and it'll query Abbott, and give you a - a list of all the disks that we have and then, uh, what's on each one, and then it shows how big the disk is and what percent full it is.
me001: Cool.
me018: So. And that's, you know, each time you go there, it's updated. So.
me001: So, the new disks are installed now? Or - ?
mn014: So what - what -
me018: The new disks are installed. If you need space just let me know. I have to create the p- appropriate sub-directory. So we're s- kinda trying to keep - even the scratch ones we're keeping a little organized, where we put a y- a U doctor speech data, and then
me001: Mm-hmm.
me018: I'll either create a sub-directory for, like if it's Meeting Recorder project, or Hub-five or whatever. So we c- I just have to create those sub-directories, and
me001: OK.
me011: Do we have new DD disks also?
me018: No.
me011: Darn.
me018: No. Nnn.
me011: So, it's all just scratch.
me018: It's all scratch.
me011: OK.
me018: Yeah.
me011: How are we doing on -
me018: Uh, DE, which is where we're putting all the meeting stuff -
me011: No, DE is full. We must be doing it on D F.
me018: No, it's D E.
mn014: D E, I think, yeah?
me018: D E's not full.
mn014: D D is full.
me018: DD's full. That was the first one. Or, that was the last one that w- filled up, and - DE still had like, last time I looked it was like seven gigs or something. So.
me011: OK, I guess I'm just one off. OK.
me018: And each meeting is roughly half
me011: Half.
me018: a gig, and so.
me011: So that means we're p- getting pretty close.
me018: We're getting close. Yeah. So.
me011: Shoot!
me018: Yeah.
me001: Are we g- just gonna keep recording? Like, at some point -
me018: Morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year. Like when we get around a hundred
me001: OK. OK.
me018: meetings. Um, because there's gonna be data coming from UW, hopefully by then.
me001: Cuz u-
me011: I just hate not to get data.
me001: How m- You're a data fiend.
me018: Yeah, it feels funny, huh? If we have the capability.
me011: Yeah.
me001: Yeah, it's like you build this room up for so long, and then it's just like, you stop.
me018: Now that we're used to recording, it's like, eh, well, why not keep going?
me011: I - The other thing we could do is stop doing the regular ones. And try to convince other topics to come in and do some. Cuz I think that would be nice.
me018: Mm-hmm. We have right now, like, seventy-five or seventy-six hours of meetings.
me011: Yeah, the other thing we were talking about also is once we exp- once the disk has been backed up, we don't actually need it on-line. So another option is to copy it to tape manually so we have the back-up copy and the tape copy, the archive copy and the back-up copy. And then just take them off-line.
me018: But aren't we still using the, uh, compressed -
me011: Once we have the expanded versions. So if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do
me018: Oh.
me011: is leave those up, and then use -
me018: Yeah.
me011: And then not necessarily have the original data on-line.
me018: Yeah, we need to figure something out, cuz the - Abbott is basically -
me011: Full.
me018: e- e- We can't add anymore disks to it. We can increase the size of the disks that are on it, but that will only take us so far. So, um, David had the suggestion about, you know, new servers and things like that, and so I'm gonna see if we can talk to Morgan about getting some money for a new disk server. And, uh -
me011: Well, that would be pretty tight i- in the machine room.
me018: Yeah, it would have to replace Abbott, basically.
me011: Eesh!
me018: Yeah. Well, he - David's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers.
me011: Mm-hmm.
me018: I think he wants to sorta go with the same type of machine for all of these. But, um - Yeah, it's full in there. Have you seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got - uh, the SUN-Blade-one-hundreds? They're like stacked up on benches and things all over.
me001: Mm-mmm.
me018: It's really crowded. So.
mn014: But they are not yet accessible? The new machines?
me018: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. They're in the - Yeah, if you do a Pmake -
mn014: Yeah? They are? Oop.
me011: What are they called? What are they named?
mn014: Yeah.
me018: Oh! I've forgotten now. Um.
me011: I assume they're in the Pmake pool.
me018: Yeah. They're in the Pmake pool. So if you do a "reginfo minus show attribute", and uh -
mn014: A what?
me018: A r-
me011: Pmake stuff. Pmake magic. Or customs magic.
me018: Yeah. Y-
mn014: Oh god.
me018: You can get a list of all the machines that are available to Pmake, by using the command "reginfo
mn014: OK. "Reginfo", OK.
me018: minus show-ATTR". Yeah.
mn014: Maybe you can send me that.
me018: Yeah. And then, um -
me011: If you do "man customs", it has almost all of that.
mn014: OK.
me018: Yeah. And - I for- I'm not sure what attributes we attach to the SUN-Blade-one-hundreds, but it could be SB-one-hundred. And so if you query for f- all machines that have that attribute, then you should see the names of the new machines. But.
mn014: OK. OK.
me011: Do we have an attribute for non-interactive machines? Cuz I was thinking that would be a good one to have.
me018: Non-interactive -
me011: Ones that aren't on people's desks.
me018: Well, there's sort of. There's this one called - There's the attribute called "no-" What's that called, uh, "n-" "no-" uh, "no-evict". Which is roughly that.
me011: Y- right.
me018: It's - Although it's like it- h- My machine has it on my desk. So, I do get jobs running on my machine all the time. Um, But, uh, So - so that's - that's sort of what it is.
me011: Yep.
me018: Uh-huh.
me011: Anyway. Shall we do digits?
me018: Sure.
me051: One three, five four, one two, two three, seven zero.
me011: And off.
