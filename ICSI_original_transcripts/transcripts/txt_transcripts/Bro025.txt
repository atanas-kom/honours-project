me018: Alright. We're on.
me013: Test, um. Test, test, test. Guess that's me. Yeah. OK.
me006: Ooh, Thursday.
me013: So. There's two sheets of paper in front of us.
mn007: Yeah. So.
me018: What are these?
me013: This is the arm wrestling?
mn052: Uh. Yeah, we formed a coalition actually. We already made it into one.
mn007: Yeah. Almost.
me013: Oh, good. Excellent.
mn052: Yeah.
mn007: Yeah.
me013: That's the best thing.
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: So, tell me about it.
mn007: So it's - well, it's spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering, um, depending on if we put - if we square the transfer function or not.
me013: Right.
mn007: And then with over-estimation of the noise, depending on the, uh - the SNR, with smoothing along time, um, smoothing along frequency. It's very simple, smoothing things.
me013: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
mn007: And, um, the best result is when we apply this procedure on FFT bins, uh, with a Wiener filter.
me013: Mm-hmm.
mn007: And there is no noise addition after - after that.
me013: OK.
mn007: So it's good because it's difficult when we have to add noise to - to - to find the right level.
me013: OK.
me018: Are you looking at one in - in particular of these two?
mn007: Yeah. So the sh- it's the sheet that gives fifty-f- three point sixty-six.
me013: Mm-hmm.
mn007: Um, the second sheet is abo- uh, about the same. It's the same, um, idea but it's working on mel bands, and it's a spectral subtraction instead of Wiener filter, and there is also a noise addition after, uh, cleaning up the mel bins. Mmm. Well, the results are similar.
me013: Yeah. I mean, it's - it's actually, uh,
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: very similar. I mean, if you look at databases, uh, the, uh, one that has the smallest - smaller overall number is actually better on the Finnish and Spanish, uh, but it is, uh,
mn007: It's worse on -
me013: worse on the, uh, Aurora - I mean on the, uh, TI- TI-digits, uh, uh.
mn007: on the multi-condition in TI-digits. Yeah.
me013: Um.
mn007: Mmm.

mn007: Yeah.

But given the limited time,
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: uh, it was sort of time to choose one.
me018: Mmm.
me013: Uh, and so, uh, th- the vector Taylor series hadn't really worked out that much. Uh, the subspace stuff, uh, had not been worked with so much. Um, so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus Wiener filtering.
me018: Hmm.
me013: Uh, we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d- uh, completely different.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: And, uh, I mean, fundamentally they're the same sort of thing but the math is a little different so that there's a - a - there's an exponent difference in the index - you know, what's the ideal filtering, and depending on how you construct the problem. And, uh, I guess it's sort - you know, after - after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me because
me018: Uh-huh.
me013: um, if you're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error? And typically you'll do - choose something like a variance. And so that means it'll be something like the square of the power spectra.
mn052: Mm-hmm.
me013: Whereas when you're - when you're doing the - the, uh, um, looking at it the other way, you're gonna be dealing with signals and you're gonna end up looking at power - uh, noise power that you're trying to reduce. And so, eh - so there should be a difference of - you know, conceptually of - of, uh, a factor of two in the exponent.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: But there're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of - of, uh, uh, over-subtraction and - and - and - and - and so forth, um, that arguably, you're c- and - and - and the choice of do you - do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand.

me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: And now we do.
me018: So will the neural net operate on the output from either the Wiener filtering or the spectral subtraction?
me013: Well, so - so - so argu- arguably, I mean, what we should do - I mean, I gather you have -
me018: Or will it operate on the original?
me013: it sounds like you have a few more days of - of nailing things down with the software and so on. But - and then - but, um, arguably what we should do is, even though the software can do many things, we should for now pick a set of things, th- these things I would guess,
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: and not change that. And then focus on everything that's left. And I think, you know, that our goal should be by next week, when Hynek comes back, uh, to - uh, really just to have a firm path, uh, for the - you know, for the time he's gone, of - of, uh, what things will be attacked. But I would - I would - I would thought- think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while because what'll happen is we'll change many other things in the system,
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: and then we'll probably wanna come back to this and possibly make some other choices. But, um.
me018: But just conceptually, where does the neural net go? Do - do you wanna h- run it on the output of the spectrally subtracted - ?
mn007: Mmm.
me013: Well, depending on its size - Well, one question is, is it on the, um, server side or is it on the terminal side? Uh, if it's on the server side, it - you probably don't have to worry too much about size.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: So that's kind of an argument for that. We do still, however, have to consider its latency. So the issue is - is, um, for instance, could we have a neural net that only looked at the past?
me018: Right.
me013: Um, what we've done in uh - in the past is to use the neural net, uh, to transform, um, all of the features that we use. So this is done early on. This is essentially, um, um - I guess it's - it's more or less like a spee- a speech enhancement technique here - right? - where we're just kind of creating
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: new - if not new speech at least new - new FFT's that - that have - you know, which could be turned into speech -
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: uh, that - that have some of the noise removed.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: Um, after that we still do a mess of other things to - to produce a bunch of features.
me018: Right.
me013: And then those features are not now currently transformed by the neural net. And then the - the way that we had it in our proposal-two before, we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features, which I guess you - you actually did linearly transform with the KLT, but - but - but - uh, to orthogonalize them - but -
mn007: Yeah. Yeah. Right.
me013: but they were not, uh, processed through a neural net. And Stephane's idea with that, as I recall, was that you'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't,
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: uh, which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when, uh, the testing set was quite different than what you'd trained your discriminant features for. So, um, all of that is - is, uh - still seems like a good idea. The thing is now we know some other constraints. We can't have unlimited amounts of latency. Uh, y- you know, that's still being debated by the - by people in Europe but, uh, no matter how they end up there, it's not going to be unlimited amounts, so we have to be a little conscious of that.
me018: Yeah.
me013: Um. So there's the neural net issue. There's the VAD issue. And, uh, there's the second stream thing. And I think those that we - last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get, uh, focused on.
me018: What was the issue with the VAD?
me013: Well, better ones are good.
me018: And so the w- the default, uh, boundaries that they provide are - they're OK, but they're not all that great?
me013: I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some- ? Is that what the deal is?
mn007: Mm-hmm. Uh, so th- um, they keep two hundred milliseconds at the beginning and end of speech. And they keep all the - Yeah.
me018: Outside the beginnings and end. Uh-huh.
mn007: And all the speech pauses, which is - Sometimes on the SpeechDat-Car you have pauses that are more than one or two seconds.
me018: Wow.
mn007: More than one second for sure. Um.
me018: Hmm.
mn007: Yeah. And, yeah, it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not - We cou- we can do better, I think,
me018: Mm-hmm.
mn007: because, um, with this way of dropping the frames they improve over the baseline by fourteen percent and Sunil already showed that with our current VAD we can improve by more than twenty percent.
me018: On top of the VAD that they provide?
mn052: No.
mn007: @@ Just using either their VAD or
mn052: Our way.
mn007: our current VAD.

me018: Theirs is fourteen?
mn007: their is fourteen. Yeah.
me018: I see. Huh.
mn007: So. Yeah. And another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for - let's say, for SpeechDat-Car. We have channel zero which is clean, channel one which is far-field microphone. And if we just take only the, um, VAD probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far-field, uh, test utterances,
me018: Mm-hmm.
mn007: then results are much better. In some cases it divides the error rate by two.
me018: Wow.
mn007: So it means that there are stim- still - If - if we can have a good VAD, well, it would be great.
me018: How - how much latency does the, uh - does our VAD add? Is it significant, or - ?
mn007: Uh, right now it's, um, a neural net with nine frames. So it's forty milliseconds plus, um, the rank ordering, which, uh, should be
mn052: Like another ten frames.
mn007: ten - Yeah.
me006: Rank. Oh.
mn007: So, right now it's one hundred and forty milliseconds.

mn007: The - The, um -
mn052: on the R .
mn007: Yeah. It's not a median filtering. It's just - We don't take the median value. We take something - Um, so we have eleven, um, frames. And - for the VAD, yeah - and we take th- the third.
me013: Oh, this is for the VAD.
mn052: Yeah. Yeah.
me013: Oh, OK.
mn052: Yeah.
me006: Dar-
mn007: Um.
me013: Yeah. Um.
mn007: Mmm.
me013: So - Yeah, I was just noticing on this that it makes reference to delay. So what's the - ? If you ignore - Um, the VAD is sort of in - in parallel, isn't i- isn't it, with - with the - ? I mean, it isn't additive with the - the, uh, LDA and the Wiener filtering, and so forth. Right?
mn052: The LDA? Yeah. So - so what happened right now, we removed the delay of the LDA.
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: Yeah.
mn052: So we - I mean, if - so if we - if - so which is like if we reduce the delay of VA- So, the f- the final delay's now ba- is f- determined by the delay of the VAD, because the LDA doesn't have any delay. So if we re- if we reduce the delay of the VAD, I mean, it's like effectively reducing the delay.
me018: How - how much, uh, delay was there on the LDA?
mn052: So the LDA and the VAD both had a hundred millisecond delay. So and they were in parallel, so which means you pick either one of them - the - the biggest, whatever.
me018: Mmm.
me013: Mm-hmm.
me018: I see.
mn052: So, right now the LDA delays are more.
me013: And there -
me018: Oh, OK.
me013: And there didn't seem to be any, uh, penalty for that?
mn052: Pardon?
me013: There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal?
mn052: Oh, no. It actually made it, like, point one percent better or something, actually. Or something like that and -
me013: OK. Well, may as well, then. And he says Wiener filter is - is forty milliseconds delay.
mn052: Yeah. So that's the one which Stephane was discussing, like -
mn007: Mmm.
me013: So is it - ? The smoothing?
mn052: Yeah. The - you smooth it and then delay the decision by - So.
me013: Right. OK. So that's - that's really not - not bad. So we may in fact - we'll see what they decide. We may in fact have, um, the - the, uh, latency time available for - to have a neural net. I mean, sounds like we probably will. So.
mn052: Mm-hmm.
me013: That'd be good. Cuz I - cuz it certainly always helped us before. So. Uh.
me018: What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that?
me013: Well, they're - you know, they're disputing it. You know, they're saying, uh - one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds.
me018: Mmm.
me013: Two hundred and fifty is what it was before actually. So, uh, some people are lobbying - lobbying to make it shorter.
me018: Oh. Hmm.
me013: Um. And, um.
me018: Were you thinking of the two-fifty or the one-thirty when you said we should have enough for the neural net?
me013: Well, it just - it - when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it, is all. I mean, how much effort do we put into making it causal? I mean,
me018: Oh, OK.
me013: I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: But, um, it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past. And we ha- you know, limited machine and human time, and effort. And, you know, how - how much time should we put into - into that? So it'd be helpful if we find out from the - the standards folks whether, you know, they're gonna restrict that or not.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: Um. But I think, you know, at this point our major concern is making the performance better and - and, um, if, uh, something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that's you know, a secondary issue.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: But if we get told otherwise then, you know, we may have to c- clamp down a bit more.

me013: If it's, you know, essentially not better, then it's probably not worth
mn007: Yeah.
me013: any more.
mn052: Yeah. But the Guenter's argument is slightly different. It's, like, ev- even - even if I use a channel zero VAD, I'm just averaging the - the s- power spectrum. But the Guenter's argument is, like, if it is a non-stationary segment, then he doesn't update the noise spectrum. So he's, like - he tries to capture only the stationary part in it. So the averaging is, like, different from updating the noise spectrum only during stationary segments. So, th- the Guenter was arguing that, I mean, even if you have a very good VAD, averaging it, like, over the whole thing is not a good idea. Because you're averaging the stationary and the non-stationary, and finally you end up getting something
me013: I see.
mn052: which is not really the s- because, you - anyway, you can't remove the stationary part fr- I mean, non-stationary part from the signal. So -
me013: Not using these methods anyway. Yeah.
mn052: Yeah. So you just update only doing - or update only the stationary components. Yeah. So, that's - so that's still a slight difference from what Guenter is trying in -
me013: Well, yeah. And - and also there's just the fact that, um, eh, uh, although we're trying to do very well on this evaluation, um, we actually would like to have something that worked well in general.
mn052: Yeah, yeah.
me013: And, um, relying on having fifteen frames at the front or something is - is pretty - I mean, you might, you might not.
mn052: Mmm.
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: So, um. Um, it'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates. Um.
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: But, um. Well, I don't know. What - what do you, uh - what do you guys see as - as being what you would be doing in the next week, given wha- what's happened?
mn052: Cure the VAD?
mn007: Yeah.
me018: What was that?
mn052: @@ VAD.
me018: Oh.
mn052: And - Oh -
me013: OK.
mn007: So, should we keep the same - ? I think we might try to keep the same idea of having a neural network, but training it on more data and adding better features, I think, but - because the current network is just PLP features. Well, it's trained on noisy PLP -
mn052: Just the cepstra. Yeah.
mn007: PLP features computed on noisy speech. But there is no- nothing particularly robust in these features.
mn052: No.
me018: So, I- I- uh -
mn007: There's no RASTA, no -
me018: So, uh, I - I don't remember what you said the answer to my, uh, question earlier. Will you - will you train the net on - after you've done the spectral subtraction or the Wiener filtering?
me013: This is a different net.
me018: Oh.
mn052: So we have a VAD which is like neur- that's a neural net.
mn007: Oh, yeah. Hmm.
me018: Oh, you're talking about the VAD net. OK. I see.
mn052: Yeah.
mn007: Mm-hmm.
mn052: So that - that VAD was trained on the noisy features.
me018: Mm-hmm.
mn052: So, right now we have, like, uh - we have the cleaned-up features, so we can have a better
me018: Mm-hmm.
mn052: VAD by training the net on the cleaned-up speech.
me018: I see. I see.
mn052: Yeah, but we need a VAD for uh noise estimation also. So it's, like, where do we want to put the VAD? Uh, it's like -
me018: Can you use the same net to do both, or - ?
mn052: For -
me018: Can you use the same net that you - that I was talking about to do the VAD?
mn052: Mm-hmm. Uh, it actually comes at v- at the very end. So the net - the final net - I mean, which is the feature net -
me018: Mm-hmm.
mn052: so that actually comes after a chain of, like, LDA plus everything. So it's, like, it takes a long time to get a decision out of it. And - and you can actually do it for final frame-dropping, but
me018: Mm-hmm.
mn052: not for the VA- f- noise estimation.
me013: You see, the idea is that the, um, initial decision to - that - that you're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly.
me018: Oh, OK. Cuz that's used by some of these other - ? Oh, OK.
mn052: Hmm.
me013: And that - Yeah. And that's sort of fed forward, and - and you say "well, flush everything, it's not speech anymore".
me018: I see.
mn052: Yeah.
me018: I thought that was only used for doing frame-dropping later on.
me013: Um, it is used, uh - Yeah, it's only used f- Well, it's used for frame-dropping. Um, it's used for end of utterance because, you know, there's -
mn007: Mmm.
me013: if you have more than five hundred milliseconds of - of - of nonspeech then you figure it's end of utterance or something like that. So,
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: um.
mn007: And it seems important for, like, the on-line normalization. Um. We don't want to update the mean and variance during silen- long silence portions. Um. So it - it has to be done before
me018: Oh. I see.
mn007: this mean and variance normalization. Um.
me013: Um. Yeah. So probably the VAD and - and maybe testing out the noise estimation a little bit. I mean, keeping the same method but - but, uh, seeing if you cou- but, um noise estimation could be improved.
mn007: Mm-hmm.
me013: Those are sort of related issues. It probably makes sense to move from there. And then, uh, later on in the month I think we wanna start including the neural net at the end. Um. OK. Anything else?
mn007: The Half Dome was great.
me013: Good. Yeah. You didn't - didn't fall. That's good.
mn052: Well, yeah.
me013: Our e- our effort would have been devastated if you guys had run into problems.
me018: So, Hynek is coming back next week, you said?
me013: Yeah, that's the plan.
me018: Hmm.
me013: @@ I guess the week after he'll be, uh, going back to Europe, and so we wanna -
me018: Is he in Europe right now or is he up at - ? Oh.
me013: No, no. He's - he's - he's dropped into the US. Yeah. Yeah.
me018: Hmm.
me013: So. Uh. So, uh. Uh, the idea was that, uh, we'd - we'd sort out where we were going next with this - with this work before he, uh, left on this next trip. Good. Uh, Barry, you just got through your quals, so I don't know if you have much to say. But, uh.
me006: Mmm. No, just, uh, looking into some - some of the things that, um, uh, John Ohala and Hynek, um, gave as feedback, um, as - as a starting point for the project. Um. In - in my proposal, I - I was thinking about starting from a set of, uh, phonological features, or a subset of them. Um, but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to, um, John.
mn052: @@
me018: Mm-hmm.
me006: He said, uh, um, these - these phonological features are - are sort of figments of imagination also. Um. S-
me018: Mm-hmm.
me013: In conversational speech in particular. I think you can - you can put them in pretty reliably in synthetic speech. But
me006: Ye-
me013: we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place. So, it's -
me006: Right. Yeah. So, um, a better way would be something more - more data-driven, just looking at the data and seeing what's similar and what's not similar.
me018: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
me006: So, I'm - I'm, um, taking a look at some of, um, Sangita's work on - on TRAPS. She did something where, um - w- where the TRAPS learn- She clustered the - the temporal patterns of, um, certain - certain phonemes in - in m- averaged over many, many contexts. And, uh, some things tended to cluster.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me006: Right? You know, like stop - stop consonants clustered really well.
me018: Hmm.
me006: Um, silence was by its own self. And, uh, um, v- vocalic was clustered. And,
me018: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
me006: um, so, those are interesting things to -
me018: So you're - now you're sort of looking to try to gather a set of these types of features?
me006: Right. Yeah. Just to
me018: Mm-hmm.
me006: see where - where I could start off from, uh, you know?
me018: Mm-hmm.
me006: A - a - a set of small features and continue to iterate and find, uh, a better set.
me018: Mm-hmm.
me006: Yeah.
me013: OK. Well, short meeting. That's OK.
me018: Yeah.
me013: OK. So next week hopefully we'll - can get Hynek here to - to join us and, uh, uh. Digits, digits.
me018: Should we do digits?
me013: OK, now .
me018: Go ahead, Morgan. You can start.
