Before we get started on this st- so I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler, who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the, um, - you know, using these structured belief-nets and stuff but starting in August, that she's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August and then we'll figure out a way for you - uh - you to get seriously connected with, um their group. So that's, uh - looks pretty good. And um - Yeah, I'll say it now. So, um - And it looks to me like we're now at a good point to do something - start working on something really hard. We've been so far working on things that are easy.
me045: Oh!
me010: Uh, w- Which is mental spaces and uh -
me045: Hmm!
me010: and-or -
fe004: It's hard.
me010: Huh?
fe004: Yeah, it's hard. Yeah.
me010: It's a hard puzzle. But the other part of it is the way they connect to
me045: Yeah.
me010: these, uh, probabilistic relational models. So there's all the problems that the linguists know about, about mental spaces, and the cognitive linguists know about, but then there's this problem of the belief-net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief-nets. Uh, which they call dynamic - they incorrectly call dynamic belief-nets. So there's a term " dynamic belief-net", doesn't mean that. It means time slices. And Srini used those and people use them.
fe004: Mmm.
me010: Uh. But one of the things I w- would like to do over the next, uh, month, it may take more, is to st- understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds and uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be, but also what that would translate into in terms of belief-net and the inferences. So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models, they're set up, in principle, so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other, and all that sort of stuff, so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh, belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate. But that's g- that's, as far as I can tell, it's - it's putting together two real hard problems. One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and - and when you have a certain, uh, construction, that implies certain couplings and other couplings, you know, between let's say between the past and the present, or any other one of these things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief-net work if it's got um, let's say one in - in, you know, different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs, or any of these other ones of - of multiple models. So um you know, in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both, uh, in a way we- that, you know, th- hopefully turns out to be consistent, so that the - Um. And sometimes it's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one because they constrain each other. I mean if you've got huge ra- huge range of possible choices
me045: Yeah.
me010: um - We'll see. But anyway, so that's, um -
me045: Oh yeah, like uh, I solved the - the problem of um - we were talking about how do you - various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote "count as a noun phrase", you know, occur as an argument of a higher construction, but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way. Um,
me010: Right.
me045: and it would take a really long time to explain it now, but I'm about to write it up this evening. I solved that at the same time as "how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase" to get something like "I the kicked dog". Um.
me010: That's great.
me045: Did it - did it at once. So maybe - maybe it'll be a similar thing.
me010: Yeah.
fe004: Cool.
me010: No, I know, I th- I- I think that is gonna be sort of the key to this wh- to th- the big project of the summer of - of getting the constructions right is that people do manage to do this so there probably are some, uh, relatively clean rules, they're just not context-free trees.
me045: Right.
me010: And if we - if the formalism is - is good, then we should be able to have, you know, sort of moderate scale thing. And that by the way is - is, Keith, what I encouraged George to be talking with you about. Not the formalism yet
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: but the phenomena.
me045: Yeah.
me010: The p- And - Oh, another thing, um there was this, uh thing that Nancy agreed to in a - in a weak moment this morning
me045: Hmm!
me010: that
fe004: I was really strong.
me045: Hmm!
fn050: Hmm.
me010: Uh, sorry. In a - in a friendly moment.
me045: Same thing.
me010: Anyway, uh, that we were - that we're gonna try to get a uh, first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week. OK? Probably skipping the mental spaces part.
me045: Alright.
fe004: Seems -
me045: Right. I do.
me010: Uh, just trying to write up essentially what - what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at. We've talked about it, but only the innermost inner group
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: currently, uh, knows, uh
me045: Knows. OK.
fe004: Yeah, and - and not even all of them really do. But like -
me045: Yeah.
me010: Right.
me045: There's - The group as a whole knows but no individual member kno-
me010: Well that that - yeah th- there's one of the advantages of a document, right?, is - is that
me045: Yeah.
fe004: Right.
me010: it actually transfers from head to head. So anyway. So um -
me045: OK.
fe004: Ah, communication!
me010: Huh?
fe004: Communication.
me010: Communication, documentation and stuff. Anyway, so, uh, with a little luck -
me045: Hunh!

me045: So, uh, what was the date there? Monday or - ?
me010: No, no, no.
me045: It's a Friday.
me010: No, w- uh - we're talking about a week fr- e- end of next week.
fe004: But, uh, but - but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th- I mean.
me045: End of next week. I thought you said beginning of n- Yeah.

me045: Yeah, I have a busy weekend but after that - Yeah, gung-ho.
me010: OK. Yeah, so - so someti- sometime next week.
me045: Great,
me010: Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: that's fine.
me045: OK.
me010: You know, if you say we're - we're dump - dump - dump . There's a really hard problem we haven't solved yet - that, that's just fine.
me045: OK.
fe004: Mm-hmm.
me045: But at - at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now.
me010: Right, t- t- if - to the extent that we have it, let's write it
me045: OK.
me010: and to the extent we don't, let's find out what we need to do.
me045: OK.
me010: So, uh
mn015: Can we - ? Is it worth thinking of an example out of our tourism thing domain, that involves a - a - a decent mental space shift or setting up -
me010: I think it is, but - uh - but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with "where is the Powder-Tower?" or whatever
fe004: Right.
me045: Well. Uh, what was supposed to happen? I've sort of been actually caught up in some other ones, so, um, you know, I don't have a write-up of - or I haven't elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about which were -
mn015: Hmm, yeah. I think - I think we already came to the conclusion that we have two alternative paths that we - two alternative ways of representing it. One is sort of a - has a um
me045: It's gone.
mn015: um
me045: The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic.
fe004: One of them was th- Right.
mn015: or comes - is resolved
fe004: Right.
mn015: later. Yeah.
me045: I think it has to be the - the second case.
mn015: Yeah.
me045: Um, so d'you - Is it clear what we're talking about here?
fe004: I agree.
me010: Uh -
me045: The question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path. Um
mn015: It's -
fe004: So you might be - yeah, y- And asking for directions.
mn015: Should we have a - a - a -
me045: or - or whether the construction semantically, uh, is clearly only asking for location but pragmatically that's construed as meaning "tell me how to get there".
fe004: Uh -
me010: Mm-hmm.
mn015: So assume these are two, uh, nodes we can observe in the Bayes-net. So these are either
me010: Yep.
fe004: Yeah.
me010: Right.
mn015: true or false and it's also just true or false. If we encounter a phrase such as "where is X?", should that set this to true and this to true, and the Bayes-net figures out which under the c- situation in general is more likely? Um, or should it just activate this, have this be false, and the Bayes-net figures out whether this actually now means - ?
me010: Uh w- that's a s- OK, so that's a - that's a separate issue. So I a- I I th- I agree with you that, um, it's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every
fe004: Slightly different.
me045: OK.
me010: uh, pragmatic reading, although there are some that will need to be there.
me045: Mm-hmm.
fe004: Good. Mm-hmm.
me045: Right.
fe004: Right.
me010: I mean, there- there's some that -
fe004: Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one. Right.
me010: You can't do that either. Yeah. But, you know, c- um - almost certainly "can you pass the salt" is a construction worth
fe004: Yeah.
me045: Yeah.
me010: noting that there is this th- this - this - this - uh
fe004: Request.
me045: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
fe004: Very yeah.
me045: So right, this one is maybe in the gray area. Is it - is it like that or is it just sort of
me010: Ri-
fe004: Mmm.
me010: Yeah.
mn015: One
me045: obvious from world knowledge that no one - you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever.
mn015: Or in some cases, it's - it's quite definitely s- so that you just know - wanna know
me010: Yeah.
me045: Yeah.
mn015: where it is.
me045: Well the question is basically, is this conventional or conversational implicature?
me010: Exactly. Yeah.
fe004: Might be, yeah.
me010: And I guess, see, the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei- f- in the short run it's more important to know how we would treat - technically what we would do if we decided A and what we would do if we decided B, than it is t- to decide A or B r-
fe004: Right.
me045: OK, right.
fe004: Right. Which one it is.
me045: Which of that is. Yeah, OK
mn015: Hmm.
me010: right now.
fe004: Cuz there will be other k- examples that are one way or the other. Right.
me010: W- we know for sure that we have to be able to do both. So I guess
me045: Yeah.
me010: In the short run, let's - let's be real clear on h- what the two alternatives would be.
me045: OK.
mn015: And then the- we had another idea floating around um, which we wanted to, uh, get your input on, and that concerns the - But the nice thing is w- we would have a person that would like to work on it, and that's Ir- Irina Gurevich from EML who is going to be visiting us, uh, the week before, uh, August and a little bit into August. And she would like to apply the ontology that is, um being crafted at EML. That's not the one I sent you. The one I sent you was from GMD, out of a European CRUMPET.
me010: It was terrible.
mn015: Agreed. Um, and one of the reas- one of the - those ideas was, so, back to the old Johno observation that if y- if you have a dialogue history and it said the word " admission fee" was uh, mentioned um, it's more likely that the person actually wants to enter than just take a picture of it from the outside. Now what could imagine - to, you know, have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history, yeah? That's the really stupid way. Then there is the really clever way that was suggested by Keith and then there is the, uh, middle way that I'm suggesting and that is you - you get X , which is whatever, the castle. The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours, that they have admission fees, they have whatever. And then, this is - We go via a thesaurus and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each e- entity. We look it up check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side. But Keith suggested that a - a much cleaner way would be - is, you know, to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you - if you know that something like that ha- has been mentioned before, this just a- continues to add up, you know, in th- in a -
me045: So if someone mentions admission f- fees, that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep- in the representation of what's being talked about. And then when someone asks "where is X?" you've already got the - the Enter schema activated and you're able to - to conclude on it. Yeah.
me010: Mm-hmm.
fe004: Kind of a priming
me010: Yeah.
fe004: priming a spreading activation
me010: Right. Yeah. So that's certainly more realistic. I m- I mean psychologically. Now technically
me045: Right. Yeah.
me010: Um
me003: Well, uh, is it - doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a - a thread, that you know, kept track of ho- of the activity of - I mean, cuz it would - the - the thread would know what nodes like, needed to be activated, so it could just keep track of how long it's been since something's been mentioned, and automatically load it in.
me010: Yeah. You could do that. Um. But here's - here's a way - in th- in the bl- Bayes-net you could - you could think about it this way, that if um at the time "admissions fee" was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter.
fe004: Turn prior on .
me003: We- yeah - th- th- that's what I wa- I wasn't - I was - I wasn't thinking in terms of Enter schemas. I was just -
me010: Fair enough, OK, but, but, in terms of the c- c- the current implementation - right? so that um
fe004: It would already be higher in the context.
me010: th- that th- the - the - the conditional probability that someone - So at the time you mentioned it - This is - this is essentially the Bayes-net equivalent
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: of the spreading activation. It's -
me045: Yeah.
me010: In some ways it's not as good but it's the implementation we got. We don't have a connectionist implementation.
me045: Yeah, sure. No, I mean
me010: Now - Now my guess is that it's not a question of time but it is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned.
fe004: Yeah, relevance. Yeah.
me045: Yeah.
me010: I mean, we could look at dialo- this is - Of course the other thing we ha- we do is, is we have this data coming
me045: Yeah.
me010: which probably will blow all our theories, but - but skipping that - so - so - but my guess is what - what'll probably will happen,
me045: Yeah, right.
me010: Here's a - here's a proposed design. is that there're certain constructions which, uh, for our purposes do change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds and th- that the, uh, standard way that - that the- these contexts work is sort of stack-like or whatever, but that's sort of the most recent thing. And so it could be that when another uh, en- tourist entity gets mentioned, you
fe004: Renew @@ Yeah.
me010: re- re- essentially re-initiali- you know, re-i- essentially re-initialize the state.
me003: Mmm.
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: And of course i- if we had a fancier one with multiple worlds you could have - uh, you could keep track of what someone was uh saying about this and that. You know, "I wanna go - in the morning I wanna -"
me045: Yeah. "Here's my plan for today. Here's my plan for tomorrow." hypothetically.
me010: Yeah, or - Yeah, in the morning morning I- I'm planning t- to go shopping, in the afternoon to the Powder-Tower -
me045: Yeah.
me010: Uh, tal- so I'm talking about shopping and then you say, uh, you know, well, um "What's it cost?" or something. Or - Anyway. So one could well imagine, but not yet.
me045: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
me010: But I do th- think that the - It'll turn out that it's gonna be - depend pretty much on whether there's been an override.
mn015: Yeah, I mean, if - if you ask "how much does a train ride and - and cinema around the vineyards cost?" and then somebody tells you it's sixty dollars and then you say "OK How much is, uh - I would like to visit the -" whatever, something completely different, "then I go to, you know, Point Reyes",
me010: Yeah.
mn015: it - it's not more likely that you want to enter anything, but it's, as a matter of fact, a complete rejection of entering
me010: Right.
fe004: Right.
me010: Right.
me045: Yeah.
mn015: by doing that.
fe004: So when you admit- have admission fee and it changes something, it's only for that particular - It's relational, right? It's only for that particular object.
me010: Yeah, I th- th- Yeah. Well, and - and - and the simple idea is that it's on- it's only for m- for the current
fe004: Yeah.
me010: uh, tourist e- entity of instre- interest.
me045: Yeah.
fe004: Right.
mn015: Yeah. But that's - I mean this - this function, so, has the current object been mentioned in - in - with a question about -
me010: No, no. It's - it - It goes the other d- it goes in the other direction.
mn015: concerning its -
me010: Is - When th- When the - this is mentioned, the uh probability of - of, let's say, entering changes-
fe004: Of that object.
me010: changes.
fe004: For - But - Right.
me003: You could just hav- uh, just basically, ob- it - It observes an - er, it sets the - a node for
me010: Yeah. Yeah.
me003: "entered" or "true" or something, "discourse enter".
me010: Now, uh - But I think Ro- Robert's right, that to determine that, OK? you may well want to go through a th- thesaurus and - and - So, if the issue is, if - so now th- this construction has been matched and you say "OK. Does this actually have any implications for our decisions? " Then there's another piece of code that presumably does that computation.
fe004: So, sort of forward chaining in a way, rather than backward. OK.
me010: Yeah. Yeah. But - but what's Robert's saying is - is, and I think he's right, is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself all the synonyms and all - you know, all the wo- Uh maybe. I'll have to think about that.
fe004: Hmm.
me010: I don't know. I mean it - th- I can thi- I can think of arguments in either direction on that. But somehow you want to do it.
mn015: Mm-hmm. Well, it's just another, sort of, construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history or changing of the probabilities, and-or -
fe004: Guess it's like - I g- The other thing is, whether you have a m- m- user model that has, you know, whatever, a current plan, whatever, plans that had been discussed, and I don't know, I mean -
me003: What - uh, what's the argument for putting it in the construction? Is it just that the s- synonym selection is better, or - ?
me010: Oh, wel- Well, the ar- the - The argument is that you're gonna have the - If you've recognized the word, you've recognized the word, which means you have a lexical construction for it, so you could just as well tag the lexical construction with the fact that it's a uh, you know, thirty percent increase in probability of entering. You - So you could - you could - you could invert - invert the whole thing, so you s- you tag that information on to the lexicon since you
me003: Mmm. Oh, I see.
me010: had to recognize it anyway. That - that's the argument in the other direction. at - at - Yeah, and this is -
mn015: Even though uh the lexical construction itself - out - out of context, uh, won't do it. I mean, y- you have to keep track whether the person says "But I- but I'm not interested in the opening times"
fe004: Yeah.
mn015: is sort of a- more a V type.
me010: Yeah there's, yeah ther- there's that as well.
mn015: Yep. Hmm. So. But, we'll - @@ uh, we have time to - This is a s- just a sidetrack, but uh I think it's also something that people have not done before, is um, sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of, uh, inferences, on whether anything relevant to the current something has been - uh, has crept up in the dialogue history already, or not. And, um I have the, uh - If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi- dialogue module of SmartKom, I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there.
me010: Good. OK. Well, this - this is highly relevant to someone's thesis.
mn015: Yes, um. That's - uh, I'm - I'm
me010: You've noticed that.
mn015: keeping on good terms with Jan. Yeah.
me010: OK. So the point is, it's very likely that Robert's thesis is going to be along these lines, and the local rules are
fe004: Oh, s-
me010: if it's your thesis, you get to decide how it's done. OK. So if, you know - if this is - seriously, if this becomes part of your thesis, you can say, hey we're gonna do it this way, that's the way it's done.
mn015: Mmm.
fe004: Yay, it's not me. It's always me when it's someone's thesis.
me010: No, no, no! No, no. We've got a lot - we've got a lot of theses going.
fe004: Now it's not. Yay! I know it is. It's so nice!
me045: There's a few of us around now.
me010: Yeah. Right.
mn015: Well, let's - let's talk after Friday the twenty-ninth. Then we'll see how f- f-

fe004: Yeah, he said he's gonna f- finish his thesis by then.
me045: Oh yeah.
mn015: Yeah. I should try to finish it by then. Yeah. So.
me010: Oh, right. Um. Yeah. So I think in fact, That's the other thing. uh, this is - this is, speaking of hard problems, this is a very good time um, to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in and - you know, where c- where the construction per- se ends and where construal comes in, cuz this is clearly part of th- Huh?

me045: Yeah, it seems to always land in your category. You're lucky.
me010: Yeah. Well, he's gonna need this.
fe004: Yeah.

me010: Yeah. No. Uh.
me045: Anyhow.
fe004: Well, I'll just pick a piece of the problem and then just push the hard stuff into the center and say it's Robert's. Like.

fe004: I can -

mn015: OK. And, um. Sounds good.
me045: Someday we also have to - we should probably talk about the other side of the "where is X" construction, which is the issue of, um, how do you simulate questions? What does the simspec look like for a question?

fe004: I - Yeah. I -
me045: Yeah.
me010: OK? So let's think of a name for - for whatever the - this intermediate structure is. Oh, we talked about semspec, for "semantic spec- specification" and that seems -
me045: Mmm.
me010: Um.
me045: It's more general @@
me010: You know, so it's a m- minimal change.
fe004: Only have to change one vowel. That's great. All the old like graphs, just change the - just, like, mark out the -

me045: Cool. Yeah. It's good for you.
fe004: Yeah.
me010: uh macros are for. Anyway, uh, so let's - let's for the moment call it that until we think of something better.
me045: OK.
me010: And, yeah, we absolutely need to find - Part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there, incl- including the questions - We didn't - we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis
me045: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
me010: in - in uh, the semspec.
fe004: Yeah, we've talked a little bit about that, too, which - uh, uh, it's hard for me to figure out with sort of our general linguistic issues, how they map onto this particular one, but -
me045: Yeah.
fe004: OK, yeah, understood.
me010: But that's part of the formalism - is got to be uh, how things like that get marked.
me045: Mm-hmm.
fe004: W- do you have data, like the - the - You have preliminary data? Cuz I know, you know, we've been using this one easy sentence and I'm sure you guys have - uh, maybe you are the one who've been looking at the rest of it - it'd - it'd be useful for me, if we want to have it a little bit more
me045: Um, I- To tell you the truth, what I've been looking at has not been the data so far, I just sort of said "alright let's see if I can get noun phrases and, uh, major verb co- uh, constructions out of the way first."
fe004: data oriented. Yeah. Mm-hmm mm-hmm.
me045: And I have not gotten them out of the way yet. Surprise. So, um.
fe004: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
me045: So, I have not really approached a lot of the data, but I mean obviously like these - the - the question one, since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that, you know, I ca- can try and, um run with that, you know, try and do some of the sentence constructions now. It would make sense.
mn015: OK. Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry?
fe004: OK.
me045: Oh yeah, the basic idea is that um, uh you know - Uh, let's see if I can formulate this.
mn015: So Mary fixed the car with a wrench.
me045: Yeah.
mn015: So you perform the mental sum and then, you know, " who fixed the car with a wrench?" You basically are told, to - to do this In the - in - analogously to the way you would do " someone fixed the car with a wrench". And then you hand it back to your hippocampus and find out what that, you know,
me045: Means.
mn015: means, and then come up with that - so who that someone was.
me045: The WH question has this as sort of extra thing which says "and when you're done, tell me who fills that slot" or w- you know. So, um.
me010: Mm-hmm.
me045: And, you know, this is sort of a nice way to do it, the idea of sort of saying that you treat - from the simulation point of view or whatever - you treat, uh, WH constructions similarly to uh, indefinite pronouns like "someone fixed the car" because lots of languages, um, have WH questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever, and you just get intonation to tell you that it's a question.
fe004: Use actually the same one.
me010: Alright, which is
me045: So it makes sense um
me010: Skolemization.
me045: Hmm?
me010: In - in logic, it's - it's - @@ it's actual- Huh? What?
fe004: Mmm. Right. Let's put a Skolem - Skolem constant in, yeah.
me045: Yeah. shko- Sure.
fe004: Yeah. Right.
me045: OK.
me010: That- that's not - that's not saying it's bad, it's just that -
me045: Right. Right. No. Of course.
me010: that - that - the logicians have - have, uh -
fe004: Mmm.
me045: That's right.
mn015: come up with this
me045: It makes sense from that point of view, too, which is actually better. So yeah, um. Anyway, but just that kind of thing and we'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on, but
me010: Good.
me045: Uh, no, all the focus stuff. We sort of just dropped that cuz it was too weird and we didn't even know, like, what we were talking about exactly, what the object of study was. So.
fe004: Um-mmm.
me010: Yeah. Well, if - if - I mean, i- part of - of what the exercise is, t- by the end of next week, is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet.
me045: Yeah.
me010: That's fine. I mean
me045: Yep.
fe004: Mm-hmm.
mn015: Well, if you - if you do wanna discuss focus background and then get me into that because - I mean, I wo- I w- scientifically worked on that for - for almost two years.
me045: Yeah. OK, then certainly we will. Good.
fe004: Yeah, you should definitely, um be on on that - maybe - maybe by - after Monday we'll - y- you can see what things we are and aren't -
me045: Yeah. w- We should figure out what our questions are, for example, to ask you. So.
fe004: Yeah. Yeah. OK.
me045: OK.
me010: Wel- then- t- Hans. Has - I haven't seen Hans Boas?
fe004: He's been around.
me045: Yeah.
me010: OK. So has he been - been involved with this, or - ?
fe004: Just maybe not today. Eh. with us? Yeah. I would say that tha- that those discussions have been primarily, um, Keith and - Keith and me, but um
me045: Yeah.
me010: Yeah.
fe004: like in th- the meeting - I mean, he sort of - I thin- like the last meeting we had, I think we were all very much part of it but um
me045: Yeah. Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a devil's advocate type role or something, like "This make - you know, I'm going to pretend I'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this. This makes no sense." And he'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing but aren't where we're at right now, so it's
fe004: but different perspec- Yeah. Right. Like - like what you call certain things, which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now.
me045: Yeah.
me010: Right. OK.
fe004: But in a sense, it's good to know that he of all people - you know, like maybe a lot of people would have m- much stronger reactions, so, you know, he's like a relatively friendly linguist and yet a word like "constraint" causes a lot of problems.
me045: Yeah. Yeah.
me010: OK. This is consistent with
fe004: And, so. Right. So.
me010: um the role I had suggested that he - he play,
fe004: Ah.
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: OK, which was that o- one of the things I would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called "Towards a formal cognitive semantics" which was addressed to these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all.
me045: Yeah.
me010: So it could be that he's actually, at some level, thinking about how am I going to communicate this story -
me045: Yeah. Yeah.
me010: So, internally, we should just do whatever works, cuz it's hard enough.
me045: Yeah. Yeah.
me010: But if he g- if he turns - is - is really gonna turn around and help t- to write this version that
fe004: Mm-hmm.
me045: Mm-hmm.
me010: does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world
me045: Yeah.
me010: um then - then it becomes important to use terminology that
me045: Yeah.
fe004: Mm-hmm. Sure.
me010: doesn't make it hard - I mean, it's gonna be plenty hard for - for people to understand it as it is, but y- y- you don't want to make it worse.
me045: Yeah. Yeah.
me010: So.
me045: No, right. I mean, tha- that role is - is, uh, indispensable but that's not where sort of our heads were at in these meetings. It was a little strange.
me010: Right. Yeah, yeah. - No, that's fine. I just wanted t- to I have to catch up with him, and I wanted t- to get a feeling for that. OK.
me045: Yeah.
fe004: Mm-hmm.
me045: So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly, you know.
me010: OK. Good.
me045: Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we're talking a bunch of goobledy-gook from his point of view.
fe004: I think it's good when we're - when we're into data and looking at the - some specific linguistic phenomenon in - in English or in German, in particular, whatever,
me010: Yeah.
me045: Mm-hmm.
fe004: that's great, and Ben and - and Hans are, if - if anything, more - you know, they have more to say than, let's say, I would about some of these things.
me010: Right.
fe004: But when it's like, well, w- how do we capture these things, you know, I think it's definitely been Keith and I who have d- you know, who have worried more about the -
me010: Well, that's good. That's - I- I- I think that should be the -
me045: Mm-hmm.
fe004: s- Which is fine.
me045: Yeah.
me010: the core group and um
fe004: Mm-hmm.
me010: that's, you know, I think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done.
me045: Yeah.
fe004: Yes. Yeah . We actually have - I think we have been making progress, and its sort of surprising. You know, like -
me010: I - I - I - I definitely get that impression. Yeah. That's great.
me045: Yeah. Yep.
fe004: Yeah. So anyone else would like uh ruin the balance of - Anyway.
me010: Well, but - Well. But th- th- then w- then we have to come back to the bigger group.
fe004: Right.
me045: Yeah.
me010: Yeah. Great. And then we're gon- we're gonna - because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff? So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that.
fe004: Yeah, we could talk tomorrow. I was just gonna say, though, that, for instance, there was - you know, out of a meeting with Johno came the suggestion that " oh, could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection?" which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about. In which case we w- we can just say that they're the effects or the bindings.
me010: Right.
fe004: Which uh, so far, in terms of like putting up all the constraints as, you know, pushing them into type constraints, the - when I've, you know, propo- then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me - you know, we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work. Right? As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably complex.
me010: Well, it -
fe004: So - Anyway, to be - to talk about later.
me010: Yeah, it has to in the sense that you're gonna use them eventu- it's - you know, it's sort of a, um, generate and test
fe004: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
me010: kind of thing, and if you over-generate then you'll have to do more. I mean, if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use uh, in your initial matching
fe004: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
me010: then you'll match some things - I mean, I - I d- I don't think there's any way that it could completely fail. It - it could be that uh, you wind up - I mean - The original bad idea of purely context-free grammars died because there were just vastly too many parses. You know, exponentially num- num- many parses. And so th- the concern might be that - not that it would totally fail, but that -
fe004: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That it would still generate too many.
me010: it would still genera-
fe004: Right? So by just having semantic- even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j- semantic types, right? Like "conceptually these have to be construed as this, this, and this"
me010: Yeah.
fe004: might still give us quite a few possibilities
me010: We don't know, but, yeah.
fe004: that, you know - And - and it certainly helps a lot. I mean, le- let's put it that way. So.
me010: No question. Yeah. And I think it's a - it's a perfectly fine place to start. You know, and say, let- let's see how far we can go this way.
fe004: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
me010: And, uh -
me003: Well it definitely makes the problem easier.
me010: I'm - I'm in favor of that. Uh, cuz I think i- I think it's - As you know, I think it's real hard and if w- if we - Right.
fe004: So Friday, Monday
me045: Yeah.
fe004: Monday. So. OK, that's - Tuesday. Like - th- that's the conclusion. OK.
me045: Yeah.
me010: Yeah.
me045: Yeah.
mn015: So, you- your dance card is completely filled now?
me045: Shoot.
me003: Mm-hmm.
mn015: Why don't -
